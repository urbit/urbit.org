## Overview

Since Port’s release it has become the preferred way for most people to get started with Urbit. With the launch of L2, we’ve seen an increase in network onboarding, most of which is exclusively done through Port. Given this it is clear that Port is critical infrastructure for the Urbit ecosystem and currently is only maintained by Hunter Miller (~nocsyx-lassul), who created it.

Our goal is to keep Port at a high level of usability and also add significant features to it over time. There are lots of opportunities to add improvements that help educate users about Urbit and give them the capability to run their ship smoothly, without CLI knowledge. We also have a unique opportunity to create a nexus for planet sales and hosting.

If you have strong design and/or development skills and are looking to make an impact with your Urbit development, this is a good project to be on. We may recruit more than one contributor for this role.
