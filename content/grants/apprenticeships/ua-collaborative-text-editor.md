A line-based editor for looking at text and code. Can be organized by projects. Allows multiple people to edit, but can use locking for now. 

Could store edits as diffs. Graph-store is probably fine for this, but a native storage format could work as well and would be good to think through tradeoffs. Interesting extensions would be things like line annotations.

This project is a good introduction to social apps in Urbit, and could become the framework for a larger product if the apprenticeship prototype works.
