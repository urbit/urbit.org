A fun client app that would be a good way to get acquainted with Urbit's networking and p2p abilities. While it would be possible to create a fully decentralized version that uses [mental poker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_poker) [algorithms](https://github.com/kripod/mental-poker) to make the game fully p2p, it is probably more tractable initially to implement the game with a centralized server.

The game can be implemented such that the central server only handles queries about current deck state, and so could be swapped out for a solution with no trusted third party at a later time.  Everything else can be handled player-side, including signing attestations of game state at different points.

### User Stories
As a gameserver admin I can:
* set up a server to handle shuffling/dealing
* take API calls from players who want to initiate a game.

As a player, I can:
* connect to another player with the app to initiate a game
* specify which gameserver I trust to handle card shuffling/dealing
* play iterated hands of poker
* update a game state that is either tournament-based (first to win all the chips) or cash-based (continually updating stacks of chips on each side, possibly with injections of money along the way)
