Elixir is an increasingly popular language with state of the art concurrency, based on the Erlang BEAM VM, and it's also a functional language with one of the most attractive syntaxes out there.

I am a web developer fluent in Ruby, JS, and working mainly with elixir for the last 5 years. I am also an Urbit user since 2019, and have already built small apps using the Urbit HTTP API to automate some tasks on my groups. I am very excited to build a full API and bring the whole functionality of the BEAM to the Urbit community.

## Milestones

Enabling a basic interface to send/receive json to a running Urbit ship.
