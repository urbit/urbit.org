Many cloud providers offer container orchestration services that abstract away from managing servers or compute instances (e.g. Amazon ECS, Azure Container Instances). A docker image tagged for the latest version of Urbit would drastically simplify the process of deploying urbits to the cloud, which is preferable for planets, stars, and galaxies.

# Deliverables
- A merged pull request to the urbit/urbit repository, with nix code to generate a docker image
  * With a volume-mountable path for a ship
  * With a volume-mountable path for a keyfile
- CI integration to release the docker image as a GitHub artifact when version releases of Urbit are cut
- CI integration to publish the image on Docker Hub when version releases of Urbit are cut
- Documentation:
  - Reference for volume mounts and controlling the behavior of Urbit in a container
    * Volume mount points for keyfiles or existing ships
    * Ports to publish for Landscape and external API access.
  - Quickstarts for deploying an Urbit ship to
    - Amazon ECS
    - Azure Container Instances
