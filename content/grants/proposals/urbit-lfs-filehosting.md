## Vision

Allow Urbit to be a personal cloud storage interface. Upload files/images to a provider and share links with chats. A technical user can be their own provider.


## Design

A provider is a ship running the lfs-provider gall app that is paired with an http fileserver.  A client  is a ship running the lfs-client gall app.

A provider can limit clients to %kids, specific groups, or manual lists of authorized ships. A client can subscribe to multiple providers.

When a client requests an upload, the provider verifies permissions and file storage limits, and returns a one-time upload url to the fileserver. 

When the uploading is finished, the fileserver notifies the provider to update client storage usage.

## Me 

I'm an experienced functional programmer, but amateur hooner. I've read through the Urbit hoon docs, and the GitHub Gall Guide, and I'm starting to appreciate the odd martian soil. I want to try building something real and practical on the platform. I want to run a personal fileserver with my Urbit instead of emailing files and moving USBs.

After completing an exploratory proof-of-concept, this proposal replaces https://grants.urbit.org/proposals/1760204192 with more detailed project milestones. 

## Milestones


### Proof of concept 
1 stars
Client – Proivder – Fileserver

Client subscribes to a provider, and pokes to request an upload. Provider creates an upload url on the fileserver, and passes it to the client.


### Upload limits
1 stars
Provider tracks uploaded files per client and enforces filesize limits based on groups, %kids, list of ships. Clients store limits locally as well.

Fileserver confirms upload to provider


### Handle Errors
1 stars
When any of the servers shutdown, a transaction is either canceled or can be resumed from a checkpoint.

Provider can import/export the map from ship to uploaded files to prevent data loss.


### Permissions and demo UI
1 stars
The fileid gives permission to delete the file on the fileserver. Create and manage share-links using fileid. Provider can throttle file requests.

Demo html/javascript UI for client to manage files.
