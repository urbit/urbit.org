Similar to other translation proposals for German and Korean, this would provide the core parts of the Documentation in the Spanish language, in order to improve accessibility and accelerate the growth of Urbit.

Translations can be provided as pull requests to the urbit.org repo, or whatever is convenient for the team managing the resource.

I am a fluent speaker with 20+ years of experience with the language and have lived in a handful of Spanish-speaking locales for several years. With professional experience as a programmer and teacher, I am skilled at breaking down complex technical concepts to new learners.
