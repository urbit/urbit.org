The goal of this proposal is to add links to the Urbit Reference docs (that is, Hoon Expressions, Standard Library, and Vane APIs).

Suppose you're browsing [section 2a](https://urbit.org/docs/reference/library/2a/) of the Hoon standard library. You see the word "unit" a bunch of times, but you're not actually sure what it means. You try to click on one of the instances, hoping it'll take you to a page with more information, but nothing happens! That's because the library (and a fair amount of Urbit documentation) lacks links between pages.

Consider, for contrast, a [random Python doc page](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html). Every concept that has documentation has a link to said documentation. By adding links to the Urbit docs, we'll make the documentation easier to use, and from there make Hoon and Urbit easier to learn.

## Milestones


### Links added to Reference documentation
1 stars
Concepts that refer to pages with documentation have links to said documentation.
