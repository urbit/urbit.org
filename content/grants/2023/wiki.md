# Description
Any user should be able to create their own wiki, share it on the network, and make it available on the public internet ("clearweb") to be accessed like any site in the vein of Wikipedia.

Wikis should fit multiple typical use cases:

- Personal knowledge management, akin to Obsidian

- Public-facing documentation, such as the urbit.org developer guide
