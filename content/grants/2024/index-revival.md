## Overview

Urbit Index was a weekly roundup of high-quality conversations in public Urbit groups, which ran from 2020 to 2022. Each Urbit Index included 5 curated quotes, with links to the groups from which they derived, plus a graphic collage. Weekly Urbit Index editions were published in an Urbit group as well as on Twitter via the now-dormant Urbit Community account. Urbit Index was widely beloved in the community and was frequently RT/QTed on Twitter. With the renewed focus on stimulating and showing off the high-quality nature of the Urbit Community, the time is right to revive the Urbit Index. Both the proposer and champion worked on the Index while employed at Tlon.

## Proposal:

Weekly Urbit Index updates, comprising:

* 3 public group conversation highlights, with links
* 5 Urbit-related written highlights (blogposts, tweetstorms, etc) from public sources on the clearweb, with links
* Collage graphic in the same style as the original series 
* Posting in a public Urbit group with initial publicity posts in other public Urbit groups
* Twitter cross-posting on a new account

The compensation will be 1 star per month upon completion of 4 weekly Urbit Index posts with accompanying cross-promotion.
