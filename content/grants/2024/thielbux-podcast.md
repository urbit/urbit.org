## Background

This is one of several community grants intended to spur use of the %radio app among high-value community members, and leverage their ability to make Urbit a center for interesting live conversations. ~dashus-navnul is a longtime Urbit community member; he previously worked on the Community team at Tlon, has hosted the On-Nomi community calls since 2021, and is the cohost of the Sovereign Stack podcast about Urbit and Reserve topics, with official support from the Reserve protocol.

## Proposal

The ‘Thielbux Podcast’ will be a weekly, 2+ hour livestream touching on Internet culture, the Urbit ecosystem, and political and artistic discussions. Each week will feature one or more guests with broad appeal inside the community and overlap to adjacent audiences. A significant amount of the discussion will involve audience questions. While the stream will be viewable on Youtube, the Youtube chat feature will be disabled and prominent messaging will direct all audience members who wish to participate to use Urbit (and boot a ship via Red Horizon link if necessary) and ask questions inside the %radio app. 


Some potential guests:
* Lord Miles
* Tom Sear 
* Zee Schwab (Column)
* Daniel Keller
* Jonathan Blow
* Ville Callio
* Monica Belevan
* Eric S Raymond
* Wolf Tivy
* Ash Milton
* Samo Burja
* Marc Hochstein
* John David Pressman
* Matt Liston
* Sam Atman
* Tony Herrera
* Sam Frank
* Joshua Reagan
* James Torre
* Jonathan Paprocki

## Criteria
No viewership criteria for the first month; 30+ Urbit users per show after that. Shows will be announced at least one week in advance in public spaces on Urbit and Twitter.

## Compensation
 1 star per month of 4 weekly shows, 2+ hours each.
