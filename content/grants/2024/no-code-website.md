## Overview

The Urbit ecosystem currently lacks a user-friendly, no-code website builder that can facilitate the creation of visually appealing and functional websites. As more individuals and communities join Urbit, there is an increasing demand for tools that simplify the process of building online spaces. This project seeks to address this gap by providing a no-code dashboard tailored to Urbit users, with design elements inspired by a clean, minimalistic style.

## Project Goals

### Develop a No-Code Dashboard

Create an intuitive, easy-to-use dashboard that allows users to build websites without writing code. The dashboard will be designed to operate seamlessly within the Urbit environment.

### Design Components

Offer a suite of pre-designed components that mirror the aesthetic and functionality of ~polwex’s existing work. These components will include layout templates, navigation menus, content blocks, and more. These include:

 * Logo: selection for browser tab and logo in upper left hand corner
 * Blog: posting function, with editing view for website host
 * Chat: which is linked to a group, also created by initiating the dashboard, or linking a pre-existing group on Tlon’s app
 * Board: Create tags and board topics with custom images for each
 * TV: chat and radio functionality.
 * Wiki: Import of %wiki with editor view for @p exceptions and host
 * Books: Static page that can host small files
 * About: Static page that can be edited by the website host
 * Search: Search across all integrated components.
 * Login: With Azimuth / Eauth.

### Ensure Compatibility with Urbit

Ensure that the websites created with this tool are fully compatible with the Urbit network, supporting decentralized hosting and interaction.
 
### Offer Customization Options

Provide users with customization options to adjust the design elements to fit their specific needs, while still maintaining the overall aesthetic inspired by ~polwex’s existing work. This is a basic site.

### Develop Documentation and Tutorials

Create basic documentation and tutorials to guide users through the process of building their websites using the no-code dashboard. 

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Research and Planning

* Analyze the design elements of ~polwex’s existing work and identify the key components that will be included in the no-code dashboard.
* Define the technical requirements for integrating the dashboard with the Urbit network.

### Phase 2: Dashboard Development

* Develop the no-code dashboard interface.
* Implement the backend logic to allow drag-and-drop component placement and customization.
* Design and integrate ~polwex’s existing work-inspired components.

### Phase 3: Urbit Integration

* Test and ensure full compatibility with Urbit for decentralized hosting.
* Optimize the dashboard for performance within the Urbit environment.

### Phase 4: Testing and Refinement

* Conduct beta testing with selected Urbit users.
* Gather feedback with the grants committee and refine the dashboard and components accordingly.

### Phase 5: Documentation and Launch

* Develop user documentation, tutorials, and walkthrough videos.
* Launch the no-code dashboard and promote it within the Urbit community.
