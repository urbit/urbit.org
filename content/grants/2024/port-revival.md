## Overview
[Port](https://github.com/latter-bolden/port) was a beloved application for launching and managing Urbit ships from a beautiful UI, all without touching the command line.

However, it is currently no longer in development or maintenance. We'd like to bring Port back as a simple and elegant entry point for Urbit users to self-host.

We will award 4 stars for taking ownership of the software and maintaining it in good working order for a period of 1 year. Bug fixes and improvements may also be part of the bounty.

## Milestones and Compensation

4 stars to be paid after 1 year from start of bounty.
