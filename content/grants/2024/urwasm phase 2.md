This is the updated roadmap for the Urwasm Project ([phase I](https://urbit.org/grants/wasm-nock)).

WebAssembly is a low-level language for a portable virtual machine. Wasm is designed to be a compilation target for a variety of programming languages and its design is hardware independent and relatively simple, making its support ubiquitous in modern browsers. Its simple design made it a perfect first candidate for a first emulator of an conventional computational system on a novel functional computer: Urbit. This is phase II of the UrWasm (_Urbit Wasm_) project.
