Infinite canvas tools provide for a way to represent data that has networked, visually organized relationships. For example, you might be familiar with personal note-taking tools like Obsidian and Roam Research, or design tools like Figma.

The [JSON Canvas](https://jsoncanvas.org) data type provides a general spec for data of this type. It's created and supported by the creators of Obsidian, but is general enough to represent any data in this format.
