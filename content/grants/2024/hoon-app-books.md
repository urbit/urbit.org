## Overview 

This project aims to create two comprehensive books that will serve as essential resources for
Urbit developers:

1. The Hoon School Book: A guide to learning the Hoon programming language

2. The App School Book: A complete guide to Urbit application development

Both books will transform existing Urbit docs into well-formatted, visually appealing, and
accessible learning resources, with additional content.

## Detailed Description

This project will produce two books aimed at supporting Urbit developers at different stages of their learning journey:

### Book 1: The Hoon School Book

Based on the Hoon School guide from docs.urbit.org, this book will:
• Compile all chapters of the Hoon School guide.
• Feature a visually distinct format for code examples.
• Include highlighted runes throughout the text.
• Provide footnotes with video links for chapters with accompanying videos.
• Include a comprehensive table of contents.
• Also include rune, syntax and aura notation cheatsheet.

### Book 2: The App School Book

Based on App School I & II and additional resources, this book will:
• Compile all content from App School I & II.
• Feature a distinct graphical style (slightly different from the Hoon School Book).
• Include extra content and reference materials with integrated cross-referencing system:
◦ External API Reference
◦ Low-level guide
◦ JSON
◦ Zuse
◦ Software Distribution
◦ HTTP API
◦ Sail (HTML)
• Contain a guide on Shrubbery.

## Technical Approach

For both books:
1. Content Extraction: Systematically extract relevant content from docs.urbit.org.
2. Content Cleanup: Convert content to a clean text format.
3. Layout Design: Create book layouts using industry-standard software.
4. Formatting: Develop distinct visual styles for chapters, subchapters, quotes and mainly
Hoon code examples.
5. Graphic Design: Apply color schemes, typography, and other design elements.
6. Cover Design: Create eye-catching covers representing Urbit, Hoon, and app development.
7. Proofreading and Editing: Ensure accuracy of content and formatting.
8. Incorporate the latest updates and changes made to the Urbit docs.
9. File Preparation: Produce print-ready files in appropriate formats (PDF).

## Timeline

2 print ready book files (cover and content), along with a physical copy, for each of the Hoon School and App School books.

Reward: 1 star

##  Expected Impact

Hoon and App School I&II Books will:
1. Provide comprehensive offline resources for learning Hoon and Urbit app development.
2. Increase accessibility of Urbit education, potentially attracting more developers to the
ecosystem.
3. Serve as polished representations of Urbit's educational resources.
4. Become offline go-to references for Hoon programmers and Urbit developers at various
skill levels.
5. Demonstrate the maturity and user-friendliness of the Urbit project to a wider audience.
6. Consolidate documentation into cohesive, easy-to-navigate volumes.

By creating these books in conjunction with the active Hoon and App Academy programs, I aim
to accelerate the learning process, provide comprehensive offline references for academy
participants, and contribute to the growth of the Urbit ecosystem.
