### Background

The Contract Application Binary Interface (ABI) is the standard way to interact with contracts in the Ethereum ecosystem, both from outside the blockchain and for contract-to-contract interaction. Data is encoded according to its type, as described in this specification. The encoding is not self-describing and thus requires a schema in order to decode.

###Bounty Description

Create a Gall app that can output the byte code for a contract ABI.

#### Gall application:

- Parse ABI into valid byte code

##### User interface:

- Allow for a user to upload arbitrary ABI
- Create a form field based on the ABI
- Parse user input into appropriate data types
- Return bytecode

### Resources:

- [ABI Spec](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.3/abi-spec.html)
