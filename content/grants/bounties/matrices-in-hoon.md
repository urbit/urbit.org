### Background

Hoon currently does not have vector or array types.

### Bounty Description

You must:
- Define a Hoon data structure for n-dimensional arrays
- Spec out Hoon type signatures for basic array functions, with an informal but coherent plan for jetting
- Implement basic array functions
- Write corresponding jets
 
You approach could follow one of many paradigms, but below are some good ideas:
- BLAS-style matrix math 
- Tensorflow
- Futhark
 
Any paradigm is acceptable as long as it results in code whose performance is at least close to on-par with NumPy.

### Resources

- [The NumPy documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/)
- [BLAS](http://www.netlib.org/blas/)
- [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/js/guide/tensors_operations)
- [Futhark](https://futhark-lang.org/examples/arrays.html)
