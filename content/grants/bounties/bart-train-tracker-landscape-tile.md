### Bounty Description

Create a backend for importing BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) arrival and departure data and service alerts via the BART public API to Urbit, and design a Landscape tile which will serve as a route planner app inside Urbit.

We would like to create a BART information Landscape tile. The backend should access real-time departure and arrival information for the complete list of stations via the BART API, as well as the data feeds for schedule tables, elevator outages, system advisories, and train counts. The tile interface should encompass:

- A real-time trip planner using the BART data, similar to the one on the official BART website. 
- Links for schedule tables for weekday, weekend, holiday service. 
- The open-source BART map linked below.
- A place (possibly a scrolling feed?) for BART service alerts.
- A place for BART elevator closure status (this is a separate data channel). 

Resources:

- [BART API Documentation](http://api.bart.gov/docs/overview/index.aspx)
- [BART API Developer License Agreement](https://www.bart.gov/schedules/developers/developer-license-agreement)
