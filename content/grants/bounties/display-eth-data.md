### Bounty Description

Create a gall application, and a user interface for that application, that are used to view events on any given Ethereum contract. Both components must meet the specifications enumerated below.

##### Gall application

- Depends upon /app/eth-watcher
- Based on contract address and ABI (json), subscribes to all contract events.
- Based on contract address, ABI, and event names/parameters, subscribe to specific events.
- Set up with just contract address, retrieving ABI from etherscan.io API.
- Stores lists of events and relevant details per contract and config, and make them available to the user interface.

##### User interface 

- Allows adding/removing watched contracts per the above app interface.
- Displays events, per contract+config or for all watched, in readable format (ie, "Transfer: from: 0xabc, to: 0xdef, value: 123", with block number or timestamp, link to transaction on Etherscan.")
- Allows visual filtering of listed events.

### Resources
