# Overview

The Urbit Bitcoin Wallet has been integrated into the core distribution, and its
maintenance is now passing back to the community via the Urbit Foundation.

Our goal is to maintain this product at a high level of usability and also add
significant features to it over time. We want usage to become ubiquitous and
easy within Urbit, while integrating without outside wallets/signing devices and
internal applications.

If you have strong development skills and are looking to make an impact with
your Urbit development, this is the project to be on. We'll likely recruit more
than one contributor for this role.

## Types of work

The below is a non-exhaustive list of the types of work we will need:

* hardware wallet support
* progress meters for wallet scanning
* performance improvements for Bitcoin providers
* mempool scanning
* shoe CLI interface for terminal usage in Urbit
* general maintenance as bugs arise

## Requirements

### Skills

* Experience with modern React, or
* Hoon experience (for backend maintenance and improvement)

Having both skills is great.

### Time Commitment

- at least 10 hours/week
- 2-3 months minimum
- weekly check-in meeting with `~timluc-miptev` (Technical Director at Urbit Foundation)

## Compensation

* 1 star per month initially (assuming ~10 hours/week part-time)
* more stars can be negotiated if the developer has greater availability and can
  commit more time
