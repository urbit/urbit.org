The Urbit Bitcoin Wallet has been integrated into the core distribution, and its maintenance is now passing back to the community via the Urbit.org Foundation.

Our goal is to maintain this product at a high level of useability and also add significant features to it over time. We want usage to become ubiquitous and easy within Urbit, while integrating without outside wallets/signing devices and internal applications.

If you have strong development skills and are looking for your entry an `impact` within Urbit, this is the project to be on.  There will likely be multiple people working on these tasks, so feel free to apply.

## types of work
The below is a non-exhaustive list of the types of work we will need:
* hardware wallet support
* progress meters for wallet scanning
* performance improvements for Bitcoin providers
* mempool scanning
* shoe CLI interface for terminal usage in Urbit
* general maintenance as bugs arise

## requirements
### skills
* JS frontend logic (should have substantial experience)
*or*
* Hoon (for backend maintenance and improvement)
Both are great. We do not need design work per se, since we do have access to some Foundation and Tlon designer time as needed.

### time
* Availability
  - at least 10 hours/week
  - 2-3 months minimum
  - weekly check-in meeting with ~timluc-miptev (Foundation director)

## Compensation
* 1 star per month initially (assuming ~10 hours/week part-time)
* more stars can be negotiated if the developer has greater availability and can commit more time
