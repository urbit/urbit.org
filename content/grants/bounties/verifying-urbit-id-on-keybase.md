Keybase is a service to aggregate multiple web2 identities and offers secure p2p messaging and file storage. Keybase assumes each ID service has multiple users. 
In the Urbit paradigm, each Uribt ID is a self-sovereign host (personal server). Each Urbit ID is one service and one user. 

### Bounty Description

Create a Gall app and that creates a Urbit ID based identity service and hosts an identity proof of the Urbit ID. Keybase offers a guide for creating these proofs and can be found at keybase guide for adding new services. 

##### Gall application:

- Create an identity service for a Urbit ID
 - Check that the config is valid
- Keybase needs to check the proof periodically on the Identity Service
- Link on the Identity Service to the corresponding verified Keybase profile
- Use Urbit ID sigil as a badge (badge: a small SVG image)

-Suggested prefilled fields:
- 'display_name': 'Urbit'
- 'Username': 'ship-name'
- Logo 32px black&white sigil and 16px black&white sigil
- 'Description': 'A clean-slate OS and network for the 21st century'

##### User interface:
- Create valid `validate_proof_config.json` using form fields
- Binary authorization
 - I am ship-name on urbit [yes or no]

- [Linking](https://keybase.io/docs/proof_integration_guide#3-linking-user-profiles)


### Prerequisites:
- Map your Urbit ID with a DNS domain
- Load an SSL certificate using acme
 - `:acme &path /top-level-domain/second-level-domain/optional-subdomain`
 - Example:  `https://zod.urbit.org` --> `:acme &path /org/urbit/zod`
