### Bounty Description

Create a backend for importing Tor network node relay search data into Urbit, and design a Landscape tile which will serve as a functional search tool for Tor relay node information inside Urbit.

We would like to create an Urbit-native Tor node relay search tool which replicates the same functions as the search tool linked below.
