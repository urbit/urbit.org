### Bounty Description

Create a backend for importing MBTA (Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority) T Train arrival and departure data and service alerts via the MBTA public API to Urbit, and design a Landscape tile which will serve as a route planner app inside Urbit.

We would like to create a T Train information Landscape tile. The backend should access real-time departure and arrival information for the complete list of stations via the MBTA API, as well as the data feeds for schedule tables, elevator outages, and customer alerts. The tile interface should encompass:

- A real-time trip planner using the MBTA data, similar to the one on the official MBTA  website. 
- Links for schedule tables for weekday, weekend, and holiday service. 
- A link to the official MBTA L Train map linked below, or an open-source workaround.
- A place (possibly a scrolling feed?) for MBTA alerts, using the ‘Alerts’ API stream.
- A place for MBTA station facilities closure status information.

- Please read the Developer License Agreement carefully and obey their guidelines for application naming and presentation of API data. 
- Submit your work as a pull request to the [urbit/urbit](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/pulls) repo
