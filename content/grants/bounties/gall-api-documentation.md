#### Background

Gall is the Arvo kernel module that controls userspace applications. Understanding its API is required for developing applications on Arvo.

#### Bounty Description

Developers should be able to use this document as a template for writing their Gall app. Arms documented should include: `+poke`, `+coup`, `+peer`, `+reap`, `+quit`, `+peek`, `+prep`,`+scry`, and `+wake`.
