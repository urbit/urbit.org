### Background

To expand Urbit’s Bitcoin-related capabilities, this bounty is to add Bitcoin support to the Urbit wallet on bridge.urbit.org.  Our ultimate goal is to create Bitcoin libraries for Urbit, enabling Bitcoin to serve as a ‘money primitive’ for future Gall apps. 

### Bounty Description

Create an SPV (simple payment verification) Bitcoin wallet within [Bridge](https://bridge.urbit.org). Bridge is written in React; please conform to the code style Bridge has thus far been written in.

A completed wallet should:
- Use the bitcoinjs-lib library for generating transactions and interfacing with Bitcoin
- Display Bitcoin balance (display as individual UTXOs)
- Generate new addresses to receive Bitcoin
- Support transaction signing and ability to broadcast to a full node specified by the node’s domain name
- Reuse login credentials to generate Bitcoin wallets / derivation path
- When logged in with a master ticket, use the ownership mnemonic. 
- When logged in with a BIP 39 mnemonic, use that as-is.
- Then, proceed as per BIP32
