Assembly 2021 marks a pivotal moment in Urbit: software distribution. Yes, Urbit is ready to be built upon. We’ll spend three days together doing just that.

- Learn about building applications on Urbit (it’s easy).
- Find out how to work and create on a platform that is fully owned by you.
- Meet with the growing ecosystem of communities and businesses built on Urbit.

If you’re simply into calm computing, well, there will be plenty of that too.

You’ll choose between two tracks:

- Assembly: Assemble software or work together on projects in small groups
- Workshop: A two day workshop taught by Neal Davis, Urbit for Developers
