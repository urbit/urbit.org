Developer calls are focused on the technologies that underpin Urbit, from the top of the stack to the very bottom. They’re an opportunity for the people developing and contributing to Urbit to share their knowledge and expertise, including things that typically don’t make it into the docs, such as how and why Urbit works the way it does.

This call will feature a discussion by Tlon engineer Mark Staarink, also known as ~palfun-foslup, about writing an HTTP BitTorrent tracker and command line app in 1500 lines of code.

The livestream will be held on YouTube, and a group video call will be made available via Google Meet after the talk for casual discussion and in-person conversation.
