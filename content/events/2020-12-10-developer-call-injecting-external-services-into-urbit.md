This call will feature a discussion by well-known developer in the Urbit community, ~timluc-miptev. ~timluc will be discussing the work he's been doing to provide access to a Bitcoin full node, which will enable Urbit ships to make Bitcoin payments to other ships. More generally, he'll be discussing the patterns that he's using to manage an Urbit ship's connection to externally-running infrastructure, and how access to that infrastructure can be provided to other Urbit nodes.

Developer calls are focused on the technologies that underpin Urbit, from the top of the stack to the very bottom. They’re an opportunity for the people developing and contributing to Urbit to share their knowledge and expertise, including things that typically don’t make it into the docs, such as how and why Urbit works the way it does.

The livestream will be held on YouTube, and a group video call will be made available via Google Meet after the talk for casual discussion and in-person conversation.
