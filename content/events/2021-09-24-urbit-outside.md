For our second post-Covid Urbit IRL, we're heading to the East Bay!

Please join us at Sibley Preserve for a hangout and (optional) hike.

We'll meet at the Sibley Staging Area at 3:00PM, and leave for a casual walk to the caldera and labyrinth at 4:00PM.

Hiking shoes, snacks, water, and picnic blankets/chairs are encouraged! There are restrooms and water at the Staging Area.

Please join the channel 'Urbit Outside ~[masked]' in ~bitbet-bolbel/urbit-community to get in touch with the gang.
