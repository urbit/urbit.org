We'll discuss mapping out the current Urbit technology complex, how to promote ongoing developer engagement and cultivation, and the upcoming Hoon School Live reboot.

Neal Davis has taught computer science at the University of Illinois since 2015. Trained as a nuclear engineer, he moved through high-performance computing into training engineers to use computers well. He has joined the Urbit Foundation to work on all aspects of our developer experience.
