Ted, the newest addition to our team, has been working on making changes to %arvo all over the place.  He'll give a short talk about some of his adventures in the Urbit OS and how they're going to make Urbit faster and easier to use.

That, and discussing why Equifax should have never been holding all that customer data in the first place.
