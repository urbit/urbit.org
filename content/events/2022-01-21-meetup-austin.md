Austin, Texas martians - come hangout and talk Urbit Friday, January 21st at 6:30 pm at Distribution Hall. We will be joined by ~poldec-tonteg, the director of The Combine (the-combine.org), which is the Urbit Foundation's incubator that invests in teams building on Urbit. He will give a presentation around 8pm on The Combine, its purpose and how to get involved as an entrepreneur. It will be followed by a more technical presentation by Edward Amsden (~ritpub-sipsyl), an Urbit kernel developer who is currently rewriting Vere, the Nock run-time environment and Urbit's virtual machine. Team members from many Urbit companies will be in attendance including ~Tirrel, dcSpark, Tlon.io, Urbit Live, Wexpert Systems, Native Planet, and Holium. Hosted by Assembly Capital and the Urbit Foundation.

If you haven't joined the network yet, bring a computer and we will help you get set up. Other than that we'll have some food, beverages and a fire, but be sure to bring a jacket too. See you there!
