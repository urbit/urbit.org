We begin the series of Urbit Meetups in Argentina by meeting in the “Sala Torrontés” of Overo Bar in the neighborhood of Palermo.

This first meeting's idea is to get to know each other among Urbit users in Argentina, share experiences and knowledge in a room with high fidelity sound system reserved only for the attendees.

Come by for a glass of wine and bring your records if you want to share music. Space is reserved for a limited time, don't be late!

See you there.
