Building solid networking infrastructure has been a major focus of the Urbit project since its inception. There's a lot going on under the hood
that ensures our servers reliably stay connected. Liam Fitzgerald (~hastuc-dibtux) will be explaining how Urbit is able to deploy changes without breaking the network. Anyone designing userspace applications will be interested in the approach he has designed.

Liam is an Interface Engineer working at Tlon working on the Landscape team. He will be discussing networking userspace applications in depth and going into detail about the new versioning system.

As usual, there will be an opportunity to jump on the call with us afterward to ask questions and hang out.
