This time Uqbar’s ~hodzod-walrus will join Neal Davis to discuss Uqbar’s latest developments in building what will be the first Blockchain on Urbit. ~hodzod-walrus will go into Uqbar’s basic outline and how they will make their plans reality. Why their ZK interpreter, Zock, is the perfect form for smart contract integration on Urbit. How they will execute parallel smart contract on Hoon and the endeavours with uHoon.

~hodzod-walrus is a programmer working on Uqbar. Previously he built Pokur as an Urbit Foundation apprenticeship grant. He’s quickly become a Hoon evangelist and hopes to showcase its strengths in the world of smart contracts.
