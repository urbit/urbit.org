Turns out that just getting Urbit fans in one room is pretty fun â€” so come hang out and have a beer.

No demos or talks this time, but we will be hosting Hoon School again soon. Just some time to hang, listen to music and meet up IRL. The room is full of desks and the internet is pretty fast. So impromptu demos and tutorials are the norm. Bring your laptop and we'll install Urbit for you. Or just relax and talk to the weird array of people who also want to replace the internet.

Feel free to bring friends!
