Please join us for a deep dive into Urbit Visor, a brand new web extension which transforms your browser into a first class Urbit client. Robert Kornacki from dcSpark will be taking viewers step-by-step through the history of how Urbit Visor came to be, starting off with his initial work on the Rust airlock implementation, moving into Login With Urbit, and finally arriving at the final product of Urbit Visor that we have today.

From there Robert will hit on many topics including:

- Live demonstration of how Urbit Visor works
- How Urbit Visor improves and increases the security of the Landscape login experience
- An overview of the first Urbit Web App: Urbit Dashboard
- Ship hot-swapping
- Streamlining the developer experience for any JS/TS dev to jump into the ecosystem and start building immediately
- UV Extensions and how they will allow Urbit and the current web to integrate seamlessly
- The long term goals and vision of Urbit Visor

Robert Kornacki (~mocrux-nomdep) is CSO at dcSpark and has been in the Urbit ecosystem since 2019. Robert has significant experience working in the crypto industry over the past several years, developing tooling and smart contract protocols which hold millions of dollars of assets to this day.

Hosted by Josh Lehman, the Director of the Urbit Foundation.
