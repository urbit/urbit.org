Galen is going to give a short (~20m) talk on designing robust human systems.  No code, no math, no time in the terminal.  This is a completely non-technical talk about design principles.  It was originally given at the IDEO Blueprint event a few weeks ago.

Above all, these meetups are for meeting other people crazy enough to think the internet can be replaced.

Feel free to bring friends!
