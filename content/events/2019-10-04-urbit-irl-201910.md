We're calling it Urbit IRL. You can use it to see your friends face-to-face, converse about Urbit, even to share a beer. And we're trying it out Friday, October 4.

We hope to see you there! If you want help installing Urbit, bring a laptop. And bring a friend, especially if they are interested in replacing the internet.
