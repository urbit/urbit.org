As many of you know, Urbit runs best when hosted, seeing that it's a server and all. The problem of course is that hosting an Urbit ship isn't the easiest of things to do for most people. Hosting Urbit ships in production is actually pretty tough though—doing it right requires wrangling the complexity of traditional "Earth" infrastructure in addition to a strong sense of how Urbit works.

In this call we're joined by Brendan Hay, the lead behind Tlon Hosting, and Lukas Bühler of UrbitHost, in what's sure to be an entertaining and informative conversation. Bren and Lukas have both been the masterminds behind their respective hosting architectures, and were somewhat surprised to learn that they'd independently settled on highly similar architectures.

This will be an unscripted conversation that's sure to span a gamut of topics including, but not limited to: the unique technical challenges of hosting Urbit ships, the upcoming %khan vane, Kubernetes operators, product roadmaps, custodianship of (or plans to do away with) private keys, and probably a ton more.

Hosted by Josh Lehman, the Director of the Urbit Foundation.
