This time Tlon’s ~palfun-foslup will join Neal Davis to discuss Urbit’s current terminal stack and the improvements he is building for it. Multiple sessions and apparently a mouse has been spotted in the upcoming release. All in all some very exciting terminal improvements are coming up shortly. For the long-term ~palfun-foslup is aiming towards native UI which he will describe as well. Be sure to join the hangout after the Developer Call to ask ~palfun-foslup everything you want to know.

~palfun-foslup has been part of Tlon for over 4 years and works in the Infrastructure team.
