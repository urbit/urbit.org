The first ever meetup of the New England Urbit Community! We will spend an afternoon discussing Martian interests and getting a feel for what this group could become in the long term. This will be an open-ended and casual afternoon. Don't feel like you have to prepare anything. Feel free to just show up and hang out.
You are encouraged to bring a friend who needs be on-boarded in to Urbit; there will be assistance and orientation materials.
You might want to bring a device just in case you need show off something cool that you're doing on Mars. This is not required, though.
If we don't like the seats in the cafe, hanging out at the nearby outside table and benches is also an option.
