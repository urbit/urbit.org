Bitcoin is coming to Urbit! With the upcoming release of the Bitcoin Wallet, you will be able to pay Urbit ships directly with BTC.

Weâ€™d like to take a moment to show it off, and discuss the future of commerce on Urbit. First, Christian and Josh will demo the wallet, then, our good friend Marty Bent will moderate a panel with Christian, Tim, and Ed. We will have time at the end for questions.

The event will have a live stream on Youtube, and a live-chat on Urbit, links to come.
