Welcome to the fifth social gathering for the New England Urbit Community, this time with tacos and chocolate nearby. Meet other people that share your interest in Urbit during this open-ended and casual meeting. Though there are no planned topics, conversations will probably cover programming, happenings in the Urbit community, and wider cultural interests.

If necessary, there will be on-boarding assistance to help newcomers join the Urbit network, so feel free to bring a device and/or a friend! The host will have packets that explain the Urbit OS and network in detail.
