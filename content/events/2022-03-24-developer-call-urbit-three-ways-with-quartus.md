Quartus Corp's ~rabsef-bicrym will join Neal Davis to discuss his ongoing endeavours to make useful software on Urbit. ~rabsef will explain three visions Quartus has for Urbit’s use - Urbit as Personal Data Assistant, Urbit as Building a Better Syllogism, and Urbit as STEAM Toy.

~rabsef-bicrym is a long-standing member of the ~dalten Collective. His path to Urbit development is non-traditional, coming from the world of the practice of law prior to working on Urbit. Quartus’s products on Urbit include `%gora` and `%crow`. They’ve also submitted several updates to the main code base including, most recently, an update to the ring signature library.

If you’d like to know more about the work Quartus is doing, join their group at ~mister-hilper-dozzod-dalten/quartus.
