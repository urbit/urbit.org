Turns out that getting Urbit fans together in one room is pretty fun. Here's an incomplete list of community-led Urbit IRL groups. These events are generally informal and very approachable â€“ feel free to dive in.

Interested in hosting an Urbit event of your own? Follow our [guide to meetup best-practices](../hosting-a-meetup). Send an email to [support@urbit.org](mailto:support@urbit.org) and we'll list your meetup on this page.
