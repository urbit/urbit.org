There are already [a few](../meetups) Urbit meetups that take place in cities around the United States. Want to start a meetup in your home town? Consider these best practices.

### Create the Meetup Group Online

The most straightforward way to start a meetup group online, like on [meetup.com](www.meetup.com). Services like this offer messaging, calendaring, payments, discussion boards, and basic group profiles.

There are other options available but, regardless of what you choose, there should be a public place on the web for people to access the group.

Group suggestions:

- Meetup.com
- Google groups
- Dedicated Website

### Spread the word

It’s not much fun if people don’t actually show up, so it’s important to get the word out. Use your existing network to tell people about your event. Remember it takes time to build a community, so don’t be discouraged if only a few people show up at your first event. Also, be sure to email [support@urbit.org](mailto:support@urbit.org), and we'll promote your meetup.

Outreach methods:

- Post to social media
- Email your friends
- Put up signs

### Format

Meetups are about sharing ideas and meeting like-minded people. There are a few formats that can help achieve this goal. As the organizer, take the lead and prepare ahead of time. Think of some topics for the group to discuss, and try to ensure that the conversation isn’t dominated by one or two people.

Presentations are a great way to share ideas. If you have a speaker for your event, coordinate ahead of time and make sure they have everything they will need to make a great presentation and ask them to arrive early to the event.

If you have a speaker, be sure to record the talk so that it can be posted online. There are plenty of people who would appreciate such content.

Format considerations:

- Guided group discussion
- Presentation

### Venue

Your meeting location can determine the success of your event. Consider how your members might get to the venue. Ideally, you’d want to be away from congested areas and find locations with good parking and transit options nearby. However, this isn’t always possible, so just do your best to accommodate. It’s also a good idea to locate the event near bars or restaurants so people can continue the conversation after the event officially ends.

Location considerations:

- Easily reachable
- Consider parking and distance to transit
- Check out public libraries
- Coworking spaces

### Date and time

Most people are able to attend meetups after work on weekdays. This isn’t true for everyone but it’s a good rule of thumb. It’s also a good idea to avoid holidays and days when there are large sporting events happening.

Date considerations:

- Weekdays
- Between 6pm and 8pm
- Avoid holidays and weekends

### Stay consistent

Like anything worth doing, meetups take time, patience, and consistency. Come prepared to engage with people and have a good time. The more often you can meet the stronger the community can become, so schedule meetups regularly.

### Bonus

Here are a few tips and tricks to consider with hosting a meetup. You don’t have to have all these things at your first meeting, but try adding them in as you go.

- Names tags
- Door signs
- Projector
- Extension cords and power strips

- Lapel microphone
- Bring your own internet
