Here's a short update from the team at Tlon for the week of `~2018.7.2`

The interface team -- *Galen* `~ravmel-ropdyl`, *Jimmy* `~haptyl-wanwes`, *Logan*
`~tacryt-socryp`, *Gavin* `~ridlur-figbud`, *Chris* `~sigtus-hossyn`, *Anthony*
`~poldec-tonteg`, and *Isaac V* `~davtyr-nimren` -- worked more on MVE. Chris
deployed a new _command palette_ for MVE to our internal testnet which we've been
playing around with and are excited to ship soon. Isaac is re-architecting
Collections a bit. Logan has been buffing up his read/unread code for Hall/Talk.
The design team has been working for a while with our `@p` ship-naming scheme
for a cool new thing. Gavin made this visualization program of the current `@p`
syllables which we've been pretty entranced by:

The constitution team -- *Mark* `~palfun-foslup`, *Curtis* `~sorreg-namtyv`,
*Morgan*  `~hidrel-fabtel`, *Will*
`~hadrud-lodsef`, *Anthony* `~poldec-tonteg`, and *Ben* `~mirfet-hocbyt` -- worked more on fortifying our summer
key-ceremony gameplan. Mark completed a BIP32 key-derivation library in Arvo. Will has a solid outline for our ETH launch
plan, which we're now getting some feedback on from our crypto nerd friends. Ben, Anthony, and Galen have been scheming a
MyUrbitWallet redesign while we're still awaiting our final contract audits. Overall, everything here is coming together.
The latest [constitution](https://github.com/urbit/constitution), [Urbit wallet](https://github.com/urbit/etherwallet),
and [Arvo](https://github.com/Fang-/arvo/tree/research-constitution) code can all be found on GitHub. We're still a short
while away from launching all of this, but we'll keep you posted.

*Joe* `~master-morzod` continued his HTTPS work, moving his development to an actual testnet to sort out the bugs
entailed by generating LetsEncrypt certificates and dynamically changing server configs on running ships. In doing so,
he's helped track down some of our gnarlier bugs (like [this one](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/issues/740)) and provided
some more food for thought for the inevitable Gall and Eyre redesigns. He's also chipping away at a UP describing all
this new, exciting functionality. We'll let you know when that comes out. Joe's
[Vere](https://github.com/joemfb/urbit/branches) and [Arvo](https://github.com/joemfb/arvo/branches) work-in-progrsss is
on GitHub.

*Curtis* `~sorreg-namtyv` worked mostly on internal Tlon things this week, but you might get a kick out of his current
rendition of renamings for some of Hoon's symbols, pointed out in this recent Fora post: [_Symbol
renaming_](https://fora.urbit.org/general/posts/~2018.7.2..01.08.03..c4af~/).

*Ted* `~rovnys-ricfer` and *Elliot* `~littel-ponnys` continued work this week on new Ford. They've been hitting several
frustrating bugs, and the code they had wasn't as easy to reason about as they were hoping. So to help tackle all this,
they decided to start re-architecting parts of new Ford to track the statuses of builds with per-build state machines.
This will entail a pretty significant reorganization of the `+ford-state` date structure, but they're confident this will
simplify new Ford's semantics and help them get this project fully across the finish line. Ted and Elliot's latest
work-in-progress can be found is [here](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/branches/all?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=ford-turbo), and
you can read their technical Fora updates [here](https://fora.urbit.org/proposals/posts/~2018.3.15..04.24.35..a47f~/).

Finally, *Josh* `~taglux-nidsep` and *Robert* `~lodleb-ritrul` continue to strengthen our documentation. Josh is well
into Chapter 2 of his new tutorials, and Rob has a couple new standard-library documentation sections which turned out to
not be documented at all until now. Josh's in-progress work is [here](https://github.com/joshuareagan/doc-drafts); Rob's
latest pull requests are [here](https://github.com/urbit/docs/pulls).

And that's the way it is. Have a great week!
