**Logan** `~tacryt-socryp` has been working with **Isaac** `~novlud-padtyv` on a new chat interface to replace Landscape and recently finished a chat wrapper API on top of Hall that enables significant performance gains, simplifies the API, and enables fine-grained unread counts per chatroom.
 
**Ted** `~rovnys-ricfer` published [an initial new Ames proposal](https://groups.google.com/a/urbit.org/forum/#!topic/dev/91oMaUwtVzE) to [urbit-dev](https://groups.google.com/a/urbit.org/forum/#!forum/dev) and abandoned the `aloe` branch for [`alef`](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/tree/alef), where the initial few thousand lines of code have now been checked in.

**Joe** `~master-morzod` worked on the DNS magic behind `arvo.network`, jet compilers with `~pilfer-pandex`, `cc-release` argument parsing, and rewrites of cue and mug.

**Elliot** `~littel-ponnys` finished a draft design of his multi-process Arvo "nuevo" design.

**Mark** `~palfun-foslup` [merged](https://github.com/urbit/azimuth/pull/17) support for delegated sending from arbitrary stars in Azimuth.

**Jared** `~nidsut-tomdun` released azimuth-js `v0.14.0`, pushed azimuth-solidity `v1.2.0` to NPM, continued work on `%gall`, and has been readying `cc-release`. 

**Morgan** `~hidrel-fabtel` has been reaching out to community members. If you're interested in talking with us about your experience with Urbit so far and what you'd like to see in the future, please let us know at [support@urbit.org](mailto:support@urbit.org). 

In other news, the [urbit-dev](https://groups.google.com/a/urbit.org/forum/#!forum/dev) mailing list has been lively, [urbit.org](https://github.com/urbit/urbit.org) now deploys automatically thanks to Netlify, and we're getting ready to breach the network for [cc-release](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/tree/cc-release) next week.

Until next time.
