Here's a short update from the team at Tlon for the week of `~2018.6.21`

![](https://media.urbit.org/fora/updates/~2018.6.13-Update-1.jpg)

The interface team -- *Galen* `~ravmel-ropdyl`, *Jimmy* `~haptyl-wanwes`,
*Gavin* `~ridlur-figbud`, *Chris* `~sigtus-hossyn`, *Anthony* `~poldec-tonteg`, and *Isaac* `~davtyr-nimren` -- worked
more on MVE. We're getting incrementally closer to being able to release a public beta. Life has been active on the
testnet as the team coordinates to fix the last known bugs and design issues.

*Logan* `~tacryt-socryp` noticed a lacking feature in Hall: read vs. unread messages, a common feature in most messaging
applications. Logan decided to embark on his first real Hoon project and successfully implemented this last week. You can
check out the code [here](https://github.com/loganallenc/arvo/tree/hall-unread), to be merged into MVE soon.

The constitution team -- *Mark* `~palfun-foslup`, *Curtis* `~sorreg-namtyv`, *Morgan*  `~hidrel-fabtel`, *Will*
`~hadrud-lodsef`, *Anthony* `~poldec-tonteg`, and Texan *Ben* `~mirfet-hocbyt` -- has been continuing to work to get us
on chain by the end of the summer. Mark has been fortifying some of the contracts and Arvo-side cryptography and Jael
functionality, while Ben and Anthony continue to finalize the control flow of our `MyUrbitWallet` fork. Curtis, Morgan,
and Will are striding forward on designing the key-launch ceremony, more details of which we'll publish soon. The latest
[constitution](https://github.com/urbit/constitution), [Urbit wallet](https://github.com/urbit/etherwallet), and
[Arvo](https://github.com/Fang-/arvo/tree/research-constitution) code with the latest Jael work can all be found on
GitHub.

*Curtis* `~sorreg-namtyv` worked more on Hoon, continuing to improve face-wrapping (variable naming) around values. He's
also been working on a couple of new runes, like `^#`, whose designs aren't yet fully complete, but when they are, we'll
document and share with y'all. Curtis' research [Arvo](https://github.com/cgyarvin/arvo/tree/research-tome) and
[Vere](https://github.com/cgyarvin/urbit-1/tree/research-tome) code can be found on GitHub.

*Joe* `~master-morzod` worked more on HTTPS this past week and got some of his work merged into the `urbit/arvo`
`collections` branch, which will go live with the MVE release. Included in the PR are new moves in Eyre and Ames to
support his reverse TCP proxy, HTTPS server configuration changes, and child-ship IP address changes. Additionally added
is a dynamic-DNS Gall app, which brings us closer to our envisioned ideal of getting `your-ship.urbit.org` to connect
directly to your ship's IP address, rather than going through Tlon's intermediary proxying ships. Our next step is to
deploy this to our internal testnet before releasing it into the wild. Joe's work can be found
[here](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/pull/752) on GitHub -- very exciting.

*Ted* `~rovnys-ricfer` and *Elliot* `~littel-ponnys` now nearly have a fully-integrated Ford Turbo. They can boot a ship
with a Clay that exclusively uses Ford Turbo and not old, slow Ford. Gall integration is also complete. Now they're
focused on finishing the caching implementation, as well as a new `%walk` schematic to perform a graph-search through the
available marks for data conversion. Ted and Elliot's work is [here](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/tree/ford-turbo) on
GitHub, and their more detailed updates are [here](https://fora.urbit.org/proposals/posts/~2018.3.15..04.24.35..a47f~/)
as comments to their original Fora post.

And last, but not least, *Josh* `~taglux-nidsep` and *Robert* `~lodleb-ritrul` have continued their much-needed
doc-improvement work. Josh's in-progress drafts of his new Hoon tutorials are
[here](https://github.com/joshuareagan/doc-drafts), and Rob's latest pull requests improving the standard library docs
are [here](https://github.com/urbit/docs/pulls). If there's anything you feel should be documented and currently isn't,
feel free to write us a comment below.

May `~zod` be with you all. Have a great rest of your week.
