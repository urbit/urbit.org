Here’s a short update from the team for the week of `~2019.2.11`:

## Network

The network has been frothy since [the transition](https://urbit.org/posts/essays/azimuth-is-on-chain/), with *Isaac* `~novlud-padtyv`, *Joe* `~master-morzod`, *Philip* `~wicdev-wisryt`, *Ben* `~pitmug-roptic`, and *Ted* `~rovnys-ricfer` working non-stop to fix first memory and then `%ames` connectivity issues. Their efforts have paid off and we now appear to be sailing calm seas.

If you haven’t booted into the new era, follow [Getting Started](https://urbit.org/docs/getting-started/) and feel free to `;join ~dopzod/urbit-help` if you need help or want to learn more about the system. See [Messaging](https://urbit.org/docs/learn/arvo/arvo-internals/messaging/) if you don’t know what that means.

If you’re having connectivity issues, make sure you're running urbit 0.7.3, try updating again, [try this fix](https://twitter.com/zodisok/status/1096982801373491202), or if you're stumped, [let us know](mailto:support@urbit.org).

## Team

*Ted* `~rovnys-ricfer` and *Joe* `~master-morzod` got an `%ames` rewrite to compile and are working on documentation and unit tests. *Elliot* `~littel-ponys` is rewriting `%eyre`, our webserver, which is some of the gnarliest code in Arvo. Outbound web requests are now working, which has allowed us to delete old `%eyre` from the [lighter-than-eyre branch](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/tree/lighter-than-eyre), and work continues porting individual `%gall` applications over to `%light`. We’re looking forward to moving Landscape onto new `%eyre` soon. *Logan* `~tacryt-socryp` is rewriting the HTTP client in Vere (Arvo’s interpreter) to better support HTTP/2. This will allow us to provide push notifications in the heretofore rumored Landscape iOS app. Finally, *Gavin* `ridlur-figbud` and *Jimmy* `fallyn-balfus` are working on a new design system to enable fast UI prototyping. We’re very excited to share more about that in the near future!

Shout-out to *Philip* `wicdev-wisryt` for [this heroic weekend PR](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/pull/1072) that fixed persistent connectivity issues on the network after [Thursday’s breach](https://twitter.com/zodisok/status/1096225302210957312).

## Media

Palladium, a magazine on governance futurism, talk about Urbit through the second half of [Palladium Podcast Ep. 2](https://palladiummag.com/2019/02/18/palladium-podcast-ep-2/) in a conversation about their recently published article [Facebook’s Political Problems are Inherent to Centralized Social Media](https://palladiummag.com/2019/02/14/facebooks-political-problems-are-inherent-to-centralized-social-media/). Worth a listen.

## Meetups

If you're in San Francisco on March 1st, we're hosting [an AMA with Galen Wolfe-Pauly](https://www.meetup.com/urbit-sf/events/259144802/), Tlon's CEO.
