**Ted** `~rovnys-ricfur` is rewriting `%ames`, Urbit’s encrypted peer-to-peer messaging protocol, in the [“aloe”](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/tree/aloe) branch. **Philip** `~wicdev-wisryt` has been working on a `bind` rune, [monadic pH tests](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/pull/1152), and `%ames` [“aloe”](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/tree/philip/aloe) with **Ted**. **Jared** `~nidsut-tomdun` is reworking `%gall` and has been pushing [Bridge](https://github.com/urbit/bridge/releases) updates with **Mark** `~palfun-foslup`. **Joe** `~master-morzod` has [cc-release](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/tree/cc-release) – the next major version of Urbit – just about ready to go. This bundles a new multi-process architecture, support for running the full bootstrap sequence, new event dispatch and persistence, a new build system, and more. **Elliot** `~littel-ponnys` merged new [event batching](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/pull/1259) (part of cc-release), which [makes Urbit performance less I/O bound](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/pull/1259#issuecomment-487785371). Finally, **Morgan** `~hidrel-fabtel` and **Alex** `~mignyt-mogseb` launched a public mailing list, [urbit-dev](https://groups.google.com/a/urbit.org/forum/#!forum/dev), a [new proposal system](https://github.com/urbit/proposals), and reimplemented [urbit.org](https://github.com/urbit/urbit.org) to enable fast builds and automatic deployment.

Until next time.
