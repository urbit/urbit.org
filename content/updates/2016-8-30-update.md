Here's August's monthly letter from Tlon, only slightly late.
We've been doing a lot of planning and, unfortunately, a little
bit of research.

We hope we're done with this research stuff.  There is really nothing
more unpleasant than CS research.  But the protocol and crypto state
(`%ames` and `%jael`) needed another round of basic architecture.

## Infrastructure milestones

By "infrastructure" we roughly mean everything in `/===/arvo,`
ie, the kernel and vanes.

Infrastructure development in the presently foreseeable future is
a system of four milestones, the first of which we've hit.  We
have a reasonably good start on the second:

- *FI - First inception*: The first milestone (August 15) was "first inception"
  (FI), where we claimed our true and final urbits.

- *CC - Continuity candidate*: The next milestone is a "continuity candidate"
  (CC), a release where it's at least possible that we'll need no further
  continuity breaches and/or reinstalls.  CC requires a nontrivial amount of
  further engineering work.

- *FC - Final continuity*: Sometime after that comes "final continuity" (FC),
  where we explicitly renounce continuity breaches.  CC to FC is a testing
  milestone and is satisfied by collective judgment.

- *SF - Security freeze*: The last milestone is "security freeze" (SF), where we
  declare the PKI final and issue live keys.

## FI: first inception

The outcome of the FI milestone was a working network, with
multiple federated stars and final `@p` names.  (Modulo some
justified complaints about the `lut` suffix.)  Federation
probably means we can invite a lot more people to Urbit and it'll
keep working, but let's still be a little cautious.

The FI keys are not final, but the cryptosystem is (though there
may be still be bugs in our implementation).

The Urbit network works and is an adequate, if still quite buggy,
social network, with two modes of social communication: chat and
long-form text with comments.

People can learn to program in Hoon and even write `%gall` apps,
but the documentation is lacking and involves wide gaps, which
must be filled by reverse engineering or public assistance.
Fortunately the Tlon people are reputed to be quite helpful.

At least one breach is certain.  All data in your FI urbits will
be destroyed!  In the breach to the CC release, we will port the
address allocation registry (the urbit.org womb) manually to the
new network.

If you have been spawning planets from your stars, you'll need to
follow our procedures, which we'll post before the next breach.
Emergency breaches may also happen.  We recommend against
spawning at the moment, but of course your star is yours.

Data in FI urbits should also be considered completely insecure.
(In fact, the urbit process probably should be run in a VM if
there is any other important data on the machine, since we have
not done any real security analysis and network data is used.)

## CC/FC: continuity

The CC release at least attempts to maintain continuity.  What is
continuity?

Continuity is when we stop rebooting the universe.  You can leave
a continuous urbit turned off on a USB key in your attic for 10
years.  When you activate it on in 2026, it will probably spend
several days upgrading itself, but it will work.

CC is just a candidate.  FC is when we actually believe we've
achieved continuity.

Here are some features we've lumped into the CC/FC bag.  This
list may expand, but hopefully won't contract.

Urbit is a reliable datastore.  For instance, as a developer, you
should edit your source files in the Urbit filesystem `%clay`,
then back them up with `git` via a one-way mirror.  (Most people
now edit outside Urbit and copy trees in.) Of course, `%gall`
application state you create in a FC urbit can and should also
last forever, via state adapters.

Urbit has a reliable storage system that can use a cluster log
like Kafka, does not lose data even on Linux, encrypts the image
as well as the log, and allows log pruning.

Urbit handles all crashes correctly on all platforms.  A stack
overflow or interrupt always produces a usable trace.

Urbit boots with the proper, beautiful, functional, boot sequence
defined in the whitepaper.  It's single-homed -- designed to
operate one ship per kernel -- and uses the event security model
from the whitepaper.

Urbit has a working end-to-end "permanent networking" message
system with in-order, exactly-once delivery and end-to-end acks,
and perfect causal consistency over the wire with no head-of-line
blocking between different ducts.

Urbit no longer mixes cryptosystem code with networking code.
Secret storage moves into a separate `%jael` vane.  `%jael` will
hold public, private and symmetric Urbit keys, foreign API keys,
tokens, passwords, etc; and other capabilities, like Urbit
invitations.

Urbit has a communication recovery procedure so that a
brain-damaged ship can resume communication after it loses
information, even if all it knows is its own identity and key.
Only-once delivery is violated, but the onus for recovery is
placed on the damaged ship rather than its healthy neighbor.

If a ship has a static IP, Urbit can serve a secure website
without proxying, either at its own urbit.org subdomain or at a
private domain.

Urbit has have a FUSE-oriented filesystem interface to the
local OS, rather than using libuv filesystem monitoring.

Urbit has a mark system that supports mark containers, and
handles mark evolution properly in both the network and the
filesystem.

Urbit handles library versioning properly in `%ford`, never using
`=>` to load libraries, using aliases correctly to allow multiple
conflicting versions in a dependency graph.

Urbit has a stable, extensible but backward-compatible I/O
protocol between Arvo and vere (the Unix process).  Any future
Arvo will work on an old vere.

Urbit uses Murmur32 rather than FNV as a short hash (mug).

Urbit is still not a cryptographically secure system, and doesn't
allow true cryptographic ownership transfers.  The cryptographic
transfer features exist, but using them is a bad idea until the
keys are final.

(For right now, everyone who issues urbits to others needs to at
least track ownership centrally, ideally with a mirror database
outside Urbit.  We could not stress this more stressfully!)

Urbit has received a thorough performance and scaling audit, and
there are no trivial efficiency problems to solve.

The Urbit console can output colored text and control a 2D ASCII
text array (curses style).  The web console (not web dojo) works
with some keylag.

All Urbit vanes are thoroughly documented/specified with an
overview document and inline comments.

## SF: security freeze

The SF release will render Urbit a "live" cryptographic system.
It is unnecessary to point out that all subsystems in the
security chain must be audited, and operational procedures for
stars and galaxies need to be standardized.

(Yes, the SF release needs to invalidate the current
cryptographic structure, even if it hasn't been compromised.
Since it's not secure, we don't know it hasn't been compromised.)

However, the SF release keys will be instantiated via network
update, which is essentially "god mode."  New keys will be
distributed to old key holders, and any disparities between
cryptographic and centralized ownership records will be resolved
in favor of the latter.  Before SF, no one can gain anything by
stealing a key or transferring it without authorization.

A software update can of course do anything to the PKI.  After
SF, at least, global Arvo updates (which ideally can become rarer
and rarer) will need to be approved through a constitutional,
republican governance process.

After the SF release, we have no control over cryptographic
transfers, but the Arvo code itself may penalize long wills to
minimize velocity and keep Urbit from acting as a currency.
(This is essentially a Tobin tax.)

The SF release needs to run the actual Arvo interpreter, with
jets, in a completely sandboxed subprocess with no I/O privilege.
Sandboxing jets, or even a safe jet language, should also be
investigated.  Network jet update must also be possible.

An SF urbit can issue and manage children without any problem.
It can be hosted easily in a commercial data centre.  The
interpreter can migrate images securely, automatically and
efficiently to a different hosting service.

An SF urbit will have a framework for DoS defence, blocking and
banning, and other nuisances of the modern world.  There will be
at least the beginning of a global reputation system.

## CC: work overview

The one subsystem that needs a complete rewrite is `%ames` (the
network).  The `%jael` vane is completely new.  Fortunately, the
new `%ames` vane compiles, and the `%jael` interface is defined
(and not that `%jael` can be complicated).

The mug replacement work is also done, but needs to be debugged
(which is no easy task).

Applying the canonical boot event system sounds like a giant
change, but it's actually pretty straightforward -- same for
single-homing.  Arvo proper is only a few hundred lines of Hoon.

The event system in `vere` needs to be replaced, but we have a
module built by a contractor with both the local FS and Kafka.

All the vanes besides `%ames` need documentation and a general
tuneup, but this should not rise to the level of a rewrite for
any other vane.

## Community involvement

Urbit's most serious problem right now is that many more people
are interested in it than are actually working on it.  This
reflects its heritage as a basement project.

Our most important work item remains opening up the codebase so
that community development can happen.  We'll start turning the
CC tasks into community operations as fast as possible.

But this is a separate topic.  It fits under a discussion of
Tlon's corporate plans and operations, which we'll post later.

## Contributors

The contributors have been amazing.  We need to make more use of
their talents, which are growing daily.  And we need to do a
better job of chronicling their deeds!  But for now, github
remembers.

## Keep in touch / office hours

`:talk` is always a great place to come and ask questions.  Going
forward someone from Tlon will be available in `:talk` from 12PM - 3PM
PDT each weekday.

Post to our [new forum](https://urbit.org/fora)!  Especially [this
thread](https://urbit.org/fora/posts/~2016.8.30..18.05.18..8ba3~/) to
discuss this very post.  Don't be afraid, the water's fine!  Actually there
are a few glitches, but it's hosted on Urbit (and also backed up).
For the less daring, [r/urbit](https://www.reddit.com/r/urbit) is a
reliable old standby.

For anything else you can always get in touch with us via
[`urbit@urbit.org`](mailto:urbit@urbit.org).
