Apprenticeships are practical learning opportunities for new Urbit developers provided by experienced members of the Urbit development community. As an apprentice, you'll have the opportunity to:

- Learn from an expert Urbit engineer
- Make real contributions to the project, and
- Earn address space for learning

Becoming an apprentice is easily one of the best ways to level up your skills, and perhaps even land a job.

## Get started

Apprenticeships are for those that are new to Urbit development (or an area of it), but not new to programming. Nearly all apprenticeships involve some degree of Hoon work, so you should make sure that you've completed [Hoon School](/docs/hoon/hoon-school/intro) and the [Gall Guide](/docs/userspace/gall-guide/intro) prior to signing up.

There are two ways to sign up for an apprenticeship:

1. [Apply for an open apprenticeship](/grants?program=apprenticeship&open=true&wip=false&completed=false#view-grants)
2. [Sign up to be matched to a mentor](https://airtable.com/shrUZQpHqRtudHhAx)

Apprenticeships are sometimes posted on the site to be claimed, but more often than not they emerge out of a conversation between a mentor and an apprentice. This is because mentors are generally busy engineering, and while they know many things that need to be done, getting those ideas into writing is difficult.

When you [sign up to be matched](https://airtable.com/shrUZQpHqRtudHhAx), the Urbit Foundation will review your application, pass it around to available mentors, and more often than not a call will get scheduled and an apprenticeship started.

## How it works

Once a mentor has written up an apprenticeship, approved an apprentice, and all parties have signed a contract with the Urbit Foundation, work can proceed.

Mentors and apprentices work together by having weekly pairing sessions and maintaining an open line of communication over Urbit. It's expected that mentors put at least two hours per week into supporting their apprentice.

When a mentor has signed off on the apprentice's work, the mentor will notify the Urbit Foundation of completion and the apprentice will invoice the UF for payment.

## Funding

Apprenticeships pay 1 star upon the sucessful completion of the apprenticeship, for an apprenticeship of a duration of up to three months. Upon completion of your apprenticeship, please [submit an invoice here](https://airtable.com/shrXXCs1uaxtNSBcg).
