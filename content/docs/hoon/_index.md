Hoon is a high-level, statically typed, functional programming language, custom-designed for use with Urbit.  For a functional language it has a surprisingly imperative style, and mastering it doesn't require knowing any advanced mathematics.

Hoon is an unusual language in several respects, both in syntax and semantics.  It uses runes (i.e., ASCII digraphs) in place of keywords, and the spacing rules are a bit strict.  A great deal can be expressed in few lines, though excessively compressed code tends to be hard to read.  Hoon has surprisingly simple semantics, but mastering it requires learning concepts that don't have close analogues in other languages.

In this section, you'll find useful resources on the Hoon programming language.
