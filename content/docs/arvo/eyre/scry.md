Here are all of Eyre's scry endpoints. There's not too many and they mostly deal with either CORS settings or aspects of the state of connections.

The first few have a `care` of `x` and are a scry like `.^({TYPE} %ex /=//=/{SOME-PATH})` (note the empty `desk`). The rest have no `care` and the tag replaces the `desk` like `.^({TYPE} %e /={SOMETHING}=)`.

All examples are run from the dojo.

## `/cors`

An `x` scry with a `path` of `/cors` will return Eyre's CORS origin registry. The type returned is a [cors-registry](/docs/arvo/eyre/data-types#cors-registry) which contains the `set`s of approved, rejected and requested origins.

### Example

```
> .^(cors-registry:eyre %ex /=//=/cors)
[ requests={~~http~3a.~2f.~2f.baz~.example}
  approved={~~http~3a.~2f.~2f.foo~.example}
  rejected={~~http~3a.~2f.~2f.bar~.example}
]
```

## `/cors/requests`

An `x` scry with a `path` of `/cors/requests` will return the `set` of pending origin requests. These are origins that were in an `Origin: ...` HTTP header but weren't in the existing approved or rejected sets. The type returned is a `(set origin:eyre)`.

### Example

```
> .^(requests=(set origin:eyre) %ex /=//=/cors/requests)
requests={~~http~3a.~2f.~2f.baz~.example}
```

## `/cors/approved`

An `x` scry with a `path` of `/cors/approved` will return the `set` of approved CORS origins. The type returned is a `(set origin:eyre)`.

### Example

```
> .^(approved=(set origin:eyre) %ex /=//=/cors/approved)
approved={~~http~3a.~2f.~2f.foo~.example}
```

## `/cors/approved/{ORIGIN}`

An `x` scry whose `path` is `/cors/approved/{ORIGIN}` tests whether the given origin URL is in the `approved` set of the CORS registry. The type returned is a simple `?`.

The origin URL is a `@t`, but since `@t` may not be valid in a path, it must be encoded in a `@ta` using `+scot` like `(scot %t 'foo')` rather than just `'foo'`.

### Examples

```
> .^(? %ex /=//=/cors/approved/(scot %t 'http://foo.example'))
%.y
```

```
> .^(? %ex /=//=/cors/approved/(scot %t 'http://bar.example'))
%.n
```

## `/cors/rejected`

An `x` scry with a `path` of `/cors/rejected` will return the `set` of rejected CORS origins. The type returned is a `(set origin:eyre)`.

### Example

```
> .^(rejected=(set origin:eyre) %ex /=//=/cors/rejected)
rejected={~~http~3a.~2f.~2f.bar~.example}
```

## `/cors/rejected/{ORIGIN}`

An `x` scry whose `path` is `/cors/rejected/{ORIGIN}` tests whether the given origin URL is in the `rejected` set of the CORS registry. The type returned is a simple `?`.

The origin URL must be a cord-encoded `@t` rather than just the plain `@t`, so you'll have to do something like `(scot %t 'foo')` rather than just `'foo'`.

### Examples

```
> .^(? %ex /=//=/cors/rejected/(scot %t 'http://bar.example'))
%.y
```

```
> .^(? %ex /=//=/cors/rejected/(scot %t 'http://foo.example'))
%.n
```

## `/authenticated/cookie`

An `x` scry whose `path` is `/authenticated/cookie/{COOKIE}` tests whether the given cookie is currently valid. The type returned is a `?`.

The cookie must be the full cookie including the `urbauth-{SHIP}=` part. The cookie must be a cord-encoded `@t` rather than just a plain `@t`, so you'll have to do something like `(scot %t 'foo')` rather than just `'foo'`.

### Examples

```
> .^(? %ex /=//=/authenticated/cookie/(scot %t 'urbauth-~zod=0vvndn8.bfsjj.j3614.k40ha.8fomi'))
%.y
```

```
> .^(? %ex /=//=/authenticated/cookie/(scot %t 'foo'))
%.n
```

## `%bindings`

A scry with `bindings` in place of the `desk` in the `beak` will return Eyre's URL path bindings. The type returned is a `(list [binding:eyre duct action:eyre])` (see the [$binding](/docs/arvo/eyre/data-types#binding) & [$action](/docs/arvo/eyre/data-types#action) sections of the Data Types document for details).

### Example

```
> .^((list [binding:eyre duct action:eyre]) %e /=bindings=)
~[
  [ [site=~ path=<|~landscape js bundle|>]
    ~[/gall/use/file-server/0w2.EijQB/~zod/~landscape/js/bundle /dill //term/1]
    [%app app=%file-server]
  ]
  [ [site=~ path=<|~landscape|>]
    ~[/gall/use/file-server/0w2.EijQB/~zod/~landscape /dill //term/1]
    [%app app=%file-server]
  ]
  ...(truncated for brevity)...
]
```

## `%connections`

A scry with `bindings` in place of the `desk` in the `beak` will return all open HTTP connections that aren't fully complete. The type returned is a `(map duct outstanding-connection:eyre)` (see the [$outstanding-connection](/docs/arvo/eyre/data-types#outstanding-connection) section of the Data Types document for details).

### Example

```
> .^((map duct outstanding-connection:eyre) %e /=connections=)
{}
```

## `%authentication-state`

A scry with `authentication-state` in place of the `desk` in the `beak` will return authentication details of all current sessions. The type returned is a [$authentication-state](/docs/arvo/eyre/data-types#authentication-state). The `p` field is the cookie sans the `urbauth-{SHIP}=` part.

### Example

```
> .^(authentication-state:eyre %e /=authentication-state=)
  sessions
{ [ p=0v3.kags1.hj7hm.6llrl.cga2j.eh1r7
    q=[expiry-time=~2021.5.20..08.44.27..39e0 channels={}]
  ]
}
```

## `%channel-state`

A scry with `channel-state` in place of the `desk` in the `beak` will return details of the state of each channel. The type returned is a [channel-state](/docs/arvo/eyre/data-types#channel-state).

### Example

```
> .^(channel-state:eyre %e /=channel-state=)
[   session
  { [ p='1601844290-ae45b'
        q
      [ state=[%.y p=[date=~2021.5.13..20.44.27..39e0 duct=~[//http-server/0v2.kmj6q/26/1]]]
        next-id=1
        last-ack=~2021.5.13..08.44.27..39e0
        events={[id=0 request-id=2 channel-event=[%poke-ack p=~]]}
        unacked={}
        subscriptions={}
        heartbeat=~
      ]
    ]
  }
  duct-to-key={}
]
```

## `%host`

A scry with `host` in place of the `desk` in the `beak` will return host details of the ship. The type returned is a `hart:eyre`.

### Example

```
> .^(hart:eyre %e /=host=)
[p=%.n q=[~ 8.080] r=[%.y p=<|localhost|>]]
```
