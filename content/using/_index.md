Welcome to the usage documentation for the Urbit project. This documentation is
maintained by [Tlon](https://tlon.io) and the Urbit community in a public
[Github repository](https://github.com/urbit/urbit.org). Issues and
contributions are welcome.

This documentation provides a series of guides and reference material for
assisting you in the usage and operations of your ship. If you're looking for
documentation on how to *develop* on Urbit, see our [development docs](@/docs/_index.md).

### [Urbit OS](@/using/os/_index.md)

This section describes how to interact with your running Urbit ship: this
includes working with the filesystem, command line (`dojo`), resolving common
issues, and more.

### [Urbit ID](@/using/id/_index.md)

Urbit ID is our [public-key infrastructure](@/using/id/overview.md), which is
what allows you to truly own your identity. Here you'll find guides for
interacting with your Urbit ID via our [Bridge](https://bridge.urbit.org)
application.

### [Running Urbit](@/using/running/_index.md)

Urbit can be run in a variety of contexts. Our [Getting Started
Guide](@/getting-started.md) covers how to run an Urbit locally on your
computer; this section covers alternative ways of running Urbit.

### [Urbit on Raspberry Pi](@/using/raspberrypi/_index.md)

This How-To guide will walk you through setting up your Urbit planet on
a Raspberry Pi 4 in a cooling case with an optimally configured SATA SSD connected 
via the USB 3 port. Urbit will run great, and youâ€™ll have enough integrated
high-speed storage to run other Urbit-related applications on the same device
in the future if you wish (e.g. a Bitcoin full node, Lightning node, etc).
