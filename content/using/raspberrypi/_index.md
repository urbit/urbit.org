### [How-To Guide for Raspberry Pi](@/using/raspberrypi/howtoguideraspberrypi.md)

This How-To guide will walk you through setting up your Urbit planet on
a Raspberry Pi 4 in a cooling case with an optimally configured SATA SSD connected
via the USB 3 port. Urbit will run great, and youâ€™ll have enough integrated
high-speed storage to run other Urbit-related applications on the same device
in the future if you wish (e.g. a Bitcoin full node, Lightning node, etc).
