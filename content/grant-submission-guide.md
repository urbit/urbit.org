The Urbit project relies on our community to help realize its potential. While the Foundation and the Community specifies the direction of development through bounties, we encourage anyone with an idea about how to improve Urbit to submit a grant proposal. This guide will describe the different types of proposals, the requested format, and the entire workflow for a successful project. If you want some ideas about projects that have a good lilelyhood of acceptance, take a look at the Grant Ideas notebook in the Foundation group.

### The Colony

The Colony consists of invited community members that have a proven track record of completing significant projects. Members of the Colony will be available to *champion* (manage and mentor) proposals. A proposal is accepted once a Colony member champions it. The Champion will then work with the contributor to see the proposal through to completion.

There will also be members of the Colony thar are invited to be on the Oracle team. The Oracle team is responsibile for ensuring proposals are correctly stuctured and payments meet current norms.

### Types of Proposals

While we will entertain just about any idea that comes from the community, we are particularly interested in "capital goods":
projects that provide new capabilities to the widest number of users and/or developers.

Proposal types include:

- Core Development - kernel or runtime development
- Application Development - userspace development of specific applications
- Developer Tools - Libraries, APIs, unit tests, etc.
- Design Work - design work for the urbit.org website
- Documentation - writing guides or website content
- Community - organizing events and meetups, staffing the help desk
- Apprenticeship - smaller scope coding projects where the emphasis is on developing skills

We have need for lots of different skill sets &mdash; not just coding.

### Format

Your proposal should include the following sections:

- Project name
- Brief description of project (short blurb for the thumbnail)
- Project Overview
- Project Scope
- Detailed behavior description
- Detailed design description
- Your experience and why you are the right person for this project
- Milestones:
  - Milestones are sub-goals of project (if any)
  - Specific deliverables
  - Expected delivery dates
  - Expected compensation in USD

For some good examples, take a look at these proposals to see the level of detail we are looking for:

- [WebRTC](https://urbit.org/grants/webrtc-gall-agent-and-external-app)
- [Urbit Visor](https://urbit.org/grants/login-with-urbit)
- [Urbit Meetup Bill of Materials](https://urbit.org/grants/meetup-bom)

### Proposal Submission and Project Workflow

Once you have your proposal draft, you will need to get it Championed by a member of the Colony. Start by creating a group on your ship named after your proposal. In this group, create a Proposal Notebook and a Discussion channel. Create a notebook entry for each of the proposal areas noted above. Notify the Foundation of your proposal by filling out the **[Propose a Project](https://airtable.com/shrgd9pQliamOFWvY)** form.

From this point, your project will go through these stages:

- **Draft**: Your proposal will be advertised to the Colony. Interested members will review it, ask questions, and offer feedback. If acceptable, a member will become your Champion. Your Champion will work with you to polish you proposal, refine milestones (intermediate deliverables along with payments), create the proposal markdown, then create the Pull Request against the urbit.org website
- **Approval**: Once the proposal PR is created, the Oracle team will review for approval.
- **Contract**: Once your proposal is approved, the PR is merged and a contract is sent for signature.
- **Live**: When the contract is signed, you can start work on your project.
- **Milestone**: When you complete a milestone (or the entire project), you will create an invoice an submit it using the
  [Submit Invoice](https://airtable.com/shrXXCs1uaxtNSBcg) form. In order to submit an invoice, you will need review and approval from your Champion and two other Colony members.
- **Payment**: Your payment will enter the payment queue. It can take up to 3 weeks to receive your payment, since we make transfers on the 2nd and 17th of the month. The Contributor will be paid the designated milestone payment and the Champion will recieve 20% of that value.

Don't be concerned if you are unclear about any of these details. We will be happy to guide you once your project enters the
workflow.

### Other Policies

- Starting in December 2021, all new project milestone payments will be denominated in USD and paid in WSTR.

- Any Contributor is limited to one active proposal/project at a time, but there may be some rare exceptions to this policy.
