Here’s a short update from the team for the week of `~2019.2.25`:

## Network

The network remains frothy, but functional. Many connectivity issues have been resolved with a `|bonk` or simply by waiting.

We published [Operating a Star](https://urbit.org/docs/getting-started/operating-a-star/) and founded a city for star operators. [Contact us](support@urbit.org) for access to the latter.

Expect a breach next week. We’ll announce the date and instructions on [@zodisok](https://twitter.com/zodisok) once scheduled.

## Team

Work continues on *Elliot*'s `~littel-ponys` [lighter-than-eyre](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/tree/lighter-than-eyre) branch. *Ted* `~rovnys-ricfer` made great strides toward the design for new `%ames`. Most notably, *Ben* `~pitmug-roptic` got a [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/) build working and [merged it](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/pull/1196) into the [cc-release](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/tree/cc-release) branch. Finally, support for push notifications is [coming along](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/pull/1203) thanks to *Logan* `~tacryt-socryp`.

## Community

The Hoon School pilot begins Monday. We've received a lot of interest since announcing it last week and we can't wait to get started. [Contact us](mailto:support@urbit.org) if you want to be added to the waitlist for future iterations.

If you're in Austin on March 8th, *Anthony* `~poldec-tonteg` and *Alex* `~mignyt-mogseb` are hosting [a meetup](https://www.meetup.com/urbit-sf/events/259307805/) at [Garage](https://www.garagetx.com/) from 5–7pm.

In San Francisco on March 26th, *Galen* `~ravmel-ropdyl` is speaking on [a panel](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-future-of-free-speech-online-registration-57429323653) hosted by [Lincoln Network](https://joinlincoln.org/) at [Galvanize](https://www.galvanize.com/campuses/san-francisco).
