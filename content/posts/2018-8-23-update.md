At Tlon, oars have been bent for some time towards getting the [Urbit PKI
bootstrapped on Ethereum](https://urbit.org/blog/2017.9-eth/). Well:
The end is in sight! We're not ones to curse an estimate with "dates," so let's
say it's "forthcoming."

This effort has spurred all kinds of updates to the system, most of which
were long in the coming and all of which will have benefits far beyond the
Ethereum roll out. We're excited to share them with y'all.

We've finalized our suggested wallet derivation scheme. This was a monumental
effort that included the expertise of a lot of different parts of Tlon,
thanks to *Morgan* `~hidrel-fabtel`, *Curtis* `~sorreg-namtyv`, *Will*
`~hadrud-lodsef` and *Mark* `~palfun-foslup`! Look forward to a full public
announcement of this derivation scheme once the audit has taken place.

Now that that's all wrapped up, we are finalizing work on client-side tools
for generating and decrypting these wallets in a usable way. *Gavin*
`~ridlur-figbud` and *Will* `~hadrud-lodsef` have been leading this effort, with
a non-trivial wasm assist from *Chris* `~sigtus-hossyn` and *Mark*
`~palfun-foslup` (codenamed the Dutch Destroyer). We now have parity between the
front end crypto tools and their Hoon-side cousins.

A key part of this is also the Wallet application, which will allow you to
manage your assets easily. *Morgan* `~hidrel-fabtel` has changed the Wallet
application architecture a bit to accommodate our wallet deriviation scheme and
we're working on getting those changes implemented. *Robert* `~lodleb-ritrul`
is on loan from the Docs team to help us make sure that all of our documentation
and copy around these tools is crystal clear.

A thread connecting these projects is our concept of the Sigil, some of the
cryptic shapes you may have seen gracing these very updates. An urbit ship is
unique cryptographic property and a Sigil is the visual equivalent of your
pronounceable shipname. Sigils will grace our applications for interacting
with the Urbit Constitution, our new Landscape UI and many other places we've
dreamt up. Work on these Sigils has reached a good point and we're working on
integrating them into these applications.

Webtalk is not long for this world, into the breach will step: Landscape.
After a lot of prototyping and design iteration, we've settled on a feature
set that will help the Urbit community (that's you!) communicate and
collaborate to reach our next incarnation. Landscape will be on your computer
and in your pocket. *Chris* `~sigtus-hossyn` and *Jimmy* `~haptyl-wanwes` have
been hard at work hitting the details of the design implementation, including
nuances like disconnected and reconnected states and other interaction concepts
that we think you'll like. *Logan* `~tacryt-socryp` has been doing double duty
on Mobile and improving `%hall` support for DMs. Needless to say, Sigils are
present throughout.

What about Arvo, you say? Well, the latest news is a veritable supercollision
of a merge between our various long running lines of work.
[Ford Turbo](https://fora.urbit.org/proposals/posts/~2018.3.15..04.24.35..a47f~/),
whose development you've all been following closely, is now in the process of
being integrated with the rest of the our code, complete with not one but two
caches (thanks *Ted* `~rovnys-ricfer`). *Elliot* `~littel-ponnys` is taking on
the task of integrating Ford Turbo with various affordance we've added in
support of Landscape. *Joe* `~master-morzod`, meanwhile, is integrating updates
to ames and the boot process occasioned by the Ethereum bootstrap. And finally,
*Curtis'* `~sorreg-namtyv` long-anticipated improvements to Hoon are being
incorporated into all of the above.

The last of these changes will be of particular interest to new learners of
hoon, since one of their benefits is the ability to pretty print type
information; a useful tool when working in the %dojo.

*Josh* `~taglux-nidsep` is closing out a revision of the docs to be released
very soon. We hope that the new docs and friendlier Goon will make the task of
learning Hoon less of a task and more of an adventure.

Next year on Mars!
