## Toward a Permanent Network

We conduct significant network upgrades to Arvo’s network protocol by “breaching” into discontinuous “eras.” Eventually, the network will reach a final era, after which no more major upgrades will be made. In the meantime, the network should be considered under test.

We are currently in the third era since [launching Azimuth](/posts/essays/azimuth-is-on-chain) and much work lies ahead. We expect network instability and regular breaching throughout the next few months. If you’re using the network today: hang in there!

## Recent Progress

Some recent process improvements should accelerate the path to maturity. Arvo updates are now continuously integrated on `~zod`, Tlon’s galaxy, through which we distribute Arvo updates. Moreover, we’re working on an integration testing framework, tentatively named pH, that allows us to test across virtual networks of ships and dramatically improve debugging.

## Getting Involved

In the meantime, there are a few things you can do to get involved.

### Get an Azimuth point

We’re working on making the process smoother, but right now you can get an Aizimuth point from a friend. You can also generate your sigil using [sigil-js](https://github.com/urbit/sigil-js), or grab it from the Azimuth points metadata API.

### Try Arvo

Arvo isn’t ready for prime time, but you can definitely experiment with it. Follow the [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) guide to boot a ship and access Landscape, our experimental messaging app.

### Join Hoon School

If you’re interested in learning how to write software for Urbit, we’ll be running online classes to teach the language, Hoon, and more in coming months. If you’re interested to join, [shoot us an email](mailto:support@urbit.org) and we’ll add you to the waitlist.
