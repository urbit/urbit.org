Here's a short update from the team at Tlon for the week of `~2018.11.20`:

![](https://media.urbit.org/fora/updates/2018.11.19-update.jpg)

The dreams of the keys crew are finally escaping their heads. After months of
excruciating reworking and fine-turning,  *Will* `~hadrud-lodsef`, *Gavin*
`~ridlur-figbud`, *Morgan* `~hidrel-fabtel`, and *Jimmy* `~haptyl-wanwes`
have completed the client-side tools for registering Ethereum addresses to
receive and access their purchased ships. The registration process begins with
the emails that we've begun to send out to ship-owners. The first batch has been
sent, and the next batches will go out in the coming week. If you own address
space, keep an eye out for an email from the urbit.org domain.

Address registration points towards the real prize: the full ledger of Urbit
ships nesting in the cozy, decentralized embrace of the Ethereum-based PKI. To
this end, *Mark* `~palfun-foslup` added some Ethereum-facing cryptographic
functions [in the form of jets](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/pull/1028). And
they do what exactly what jets are supposed to do: take things from "unusably
slow" to "actually pretty good." This means that we can start deploying
Constitution transactions.

Performance isn't always a matter of engineering challenges being surmounted,
though. Occasionally it's a matter of hearing the cracking of joints in
something that's turning the wrong way. *Elliot* `~littel-ponnys` felt something
so ghastly: a 200-millisecond delay on every Ford build. So the search began.
What was uncovered was two otherwise-benign lines that didn't get along with
*Paul's* `~fodwyt-ragful` recently merged Vere changes. Elliot handled the
Arvo side, Paul charged the Vere flank, and the build-system bug was vanquished.

Yes, Urbit is a mission fearsome and sprawling, but we at Tlon live for the
hunt. Tearing up and replacing the entire stack just isn't enough, so we put our
own, meticulous spin on the concept of a cryptocurrency wallet. The *Urbit
Hierarchical Deterministic Wallet* is a _system_ of related key-pairs that have
distinct powers. That's because you want it to be easy to, say, authenticate
packets without having to risk a chunk of your net worth. It's *deterministic*
because key-pairs of a lower tier can be derived from those of a higher-tier,
making the whole system a nice balance of usability and security. Sound cool?
Check out the details in Tlon's
[Urbit Proposal](https://fora.urbit.org/proposals/posts/~2018.11.8..19.31.59..ba77~/)
on the matter.

See you next week.

*Rob* `~lodleb-ritrul`
