Here is a smattering of the exciting things going on at Tlon this week.

Now that we know what the infrastructure for transferring our current
property registry will look like, *Will* `~hadrud-lodsef`, *Morgan*
`~hidrel-fabtel` are getting the logistics in order. Primary to this is securely
generating new keys and securely transferring existing assets. Since Tlon owns a
_bit_ of address space, we're particularly interested in making sure this
transfer goes down smoothly!

The Landscape team has been busy integrating changes to Collections (our new
concept for writing, reading and subscribing to static files... like this one!).
Our very own Canadian visionary *Isaac* `~davtyr-nimren` did a redesign recently
that makes this system more general and takes advantage of the permissions in
our file system, `%clay`.

Of course, what kind of a square only chats from their desk? Don't most of us
want to chat from our soylent-powered electric scooters as well? Luckily,
wunderkinder *Logan* `~tacryt-socryp` and *Jimmy* `~haptyl-wanwes` have been
grinding on Landscape mobile, including new features such as slick navigation
an improved DM flow and, maybe most importantly, a QR-based device pairing flow.

*Mark*, resident solidity jurist, is busy updating `%jael` (our vane for
handling secrets) to accomodate our newest Constitution.

*Joe* `~master-morzod` is making good use of his time in the office to make
everyone else feel unproductive. Not only is he the maestro behind the
mergepocalypse that I mentioned last week, he is also finishing up work on
booting a ship using a keypair generated by, you guessed it, the front end key
tools mentioned above.

Ford Turbo is getting a good work out from its integration with the updates we
made to `%arvo` to accomodate Landscape. Dynamic duo *Ted* `~rovnys-ricfer` and
*Elliot* `~littel-ponnys` are fixing these bugs and updating the test suite to
account for these cases.

Last but not least *David* `~patpex_ponleg` joins the Docs crew. *David* has
experience teaching programming, and has even used Hoon in his classes. We're
happy to have him help us teach the world to hoon. Come and say hi to him on
`%talk`, or even better, ask him to help you with your hoon homework ;)

Next year on Mars!
