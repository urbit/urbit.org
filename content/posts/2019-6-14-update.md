**Jared** `~nidsut-tomdun` has been putting final touches on the Urbit `0.8.0` (formerly "cc-release") and pushed new versions of [azimuth-js](https://github.com/urbit/azimuth-js/releases) and [urbit-key-generation](https://github.com/urbit/urbit-key-generation/releases).

**Philip** `~wicdev-wisryt` improved his new async monad and its example apps. Read more about that [here](https://groups.google.com/a/urbit.org/forum/#!topic/dev/DDG6gHSG1Lc) and in the [original PR](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/pull/1183).

**Ted** `~rovnys-ricfer`, with **Philip**, made progress on new `%ames` architecture and implementation. Follow along with some of the recent discussion in [this post](https://groups.google.com/a/urbit.org/forum/#!topic/dev/y_gaSpn9mxM). 


**Elliot** `~littel-ponnys` finished an initial implementation of ring signatures in Arvo, including a basic voting app, described in a [post](https://groups.google.com/a/urbit.org/forum/#!topic/dev/IG-FdVpEGX0) to urbit-dev. He also worked on a forthcoming Haskell rewrite of Vere with `~pitmug-roptec` and his multi-process Urbit "Nuevo" design.

**Joe** `~master-morzod` worked on some Hoon bugs, reviewed the `lighter-than-eyre` branch – which won't be released in 0.8.0 – and has been working to simplify the DNS magic that makes ship.arvo.network work. 

`~rigdyn-sondur` is on the home stretch with [64-bit Vere](https://github.com/BernardoDeLaPlaz/urbit/commits/vere_64). 

Until next time.

**Morgan** `~hidrel-fabtel`
