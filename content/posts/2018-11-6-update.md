Here's a short update from the team at Tlon for the week of `~2018.11.6`:

![](https://media.urbit.org/fora/updates/2018.11.7-update.jpg)

*Gavin* `~ridlur-figbud`, *Will* `~hadrud-lodsef`,  and *Jimmy* `~haptyl-wanwes`
have been working tirelessly on the front-end tooling for bootstrapping our
[PKI on Ethereum](https://urbit.org/blog/2017.9-eth/). The fruits of their labor
are nearly ripe: all that's left is finalizing the copy and the documentation.

*Philip* `~wicdev-wisryt`, a powerful Hoonist, is making sure that the Arvo
level of the stack is ready for the Great PKI Migration. Previously, every time
a ship booted, it would need to process every Ethereum block all the way up to
the present. This was _slow_, and we prefer life in the fast lane. So Philip
souped up `%jael`, our keys vane. When a child boots now, its parent sends it a
snapshot of the blockchain, rather than each individual event. And if we ever
need to revert some events because of a chain reorganization, we can just
restore an earlier snapshot instead of starting from scratch.

Landscape is the charming, user-facing bow on the top of all of this, and it's
just completed the first round of internal user-feedback testing. The entire
company came together to raise interface hell, providing *Isaac*
`~davtyr-nimren` and *Chris* `~sigtus-hossyn` with a lot of useful data on the
performance and reliability characteristics of the web-facing Arvo
infrastructure, by way of the profiler in the Arvo interpreter.

Pretty sweet.

Or, _probably_ sweet. They tell you in college that it's never a compiler error,
but some of the "interesting" results of our profiling may, in fact, be
artifacts of a compiler error. *Ted* `~rovnys-ricfer` and *Elliot*
`~littel-ponnys` are spelunking the lowest depths of the stack, illuminating any
profiler bugs with their combined brilliance. It's unlikely that our heroes will
find any Balrogs, but you can never be too sure.

It won't be long now, Martians.
