Here's a short update from the team at Tlon for the week of `~2018.7.13`:

> "A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple
  system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and
  cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working
  simple system."

-[John Gall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gall_(author)
