Here's a short update from the team at Tlon for the week of `~2019.2.5`:

![](https://media.urbit.org/fora/updates/2019.2.4-update.jpg)

Welcome to the other side. The Urbit PKI, Azimuth, now fully [migrated to the Ethereum blockchain](https://urbit.org/posts/essays/azimuth-is-on-chain/). This migration means that all address-space-holders have cryptographic ownership of their assets. The guide to getting on the network can be found [here](https://urbit.org/docs/getting-started/).

Azimuth is one of three layers of the Urbit project, alongside _Arvo_ and _Aegean_. Arvo is the Urbit operating system. Aegean is something more abstract; a pattern for building “cities”: Urbit communities whose members run the same custom suite of software on their Arvo servers.  Our [Primer](https://urbit.org/primer/) explains these concepts in depth.

An integration of this size is not without its difficulties, though. ~zod labored mightily for a few days then `bail: meme`d (Arvo for “ran out of memory”). *Joe* `~master-morzod`, *Ted* `~rovnys-ricfer`, and *Isaac* `~novlud-padtyv` discovered the problem: `~zod` had so many neighbors that Vere ran out of memory upon restart. [One fix](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/pull/1167) changed how Vere put header metadata on the event log, allowing it to be traversed both forwards and backwards, and [another fix](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/pull/1180) conserves memory by clearing the cache more often. A [third improvement](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/pull/1171) brings an important memory diagnostic tool, `|mass`, back to Arvo. Our champions breached the network to implement these changes, and problems seemed to be solved. _However_, they ran into new issues with event-playback, and they’ve been debugging that ever since.

(There’s also a new Twitter account, [@zodisok](https://twitter.com/zodisok), that tweets out updates about `~zod`’s network status and any relevant pull-requests. It also provides a bit more insight into the challenges of building your own tools to maintain a network. Follow it to stay in the loop.)

*Will* `~hadrud-lodsef`, *Gavin* `~ridlur-figbud`, and *Jared* `~nidsut-tomdun` are making incremental changes to our Azimuth front-end, Bridge: UI fixes, new wallet support, adding conditional star-release capabilities for galaxies, and integrating a wallet-generator feature. The Bridge crew will try to implement these changes on a weekly schedule, and you can keep track of them in the Bridge repo’s new [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/urbit/bridge/blob/master/CHANGELOG) file.

BONUS: *Mark* `~palfun-foslup` aka The Dutch Destroyer decided that full bitcoinification was not happening fast enough for his liking and submitted a PR that added bitcoin rpc support to Arvo. Watch the demo [here](https://twitter.com/mdfang/status/1092171862178701313).

See you next week.
