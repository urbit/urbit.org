Hereâ€™s a short update from the team as of `~2019.4.11`:

![](https://media.urbit.org/site/posts/updates/~2019.4.11-update-1.jpg)

## Team

*Philip* `~wicdev-wisryt` made progress on `%aqua`, simulated Arvo instances running in Arvo, and getting individual continuity breaches working, which will enable resetting of sunk ships. *Elliot* `~littel-ponnys` and *Joe* `~master-morzod` have been [readying](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/pull/1232) `cc-release` for release. *Ted* `~rovnys-ricfur` has been [laying the groundwork](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/pull/1135) for future error handling and making progress on new `%ames`. *Ben* `~pitmug-roptec` and `pilfer-pandex` continued work on Hoon's type system. Finally, *Jared* `~nidsut-tomdun` is revamping `%gall`, currently `+mo` and `+ap`.

## Community

We conducted an Azimuth AMA and an "IDEA BLITZ" on Landscape. Excerpts from the IDEA BLITZ are collected in [a Github issue](https://github.com/urbit/proposals/issues/4), and archives are available at `~dopzod/azimuth-ama` and `~dopzod/idea-blitz`.

## April Fools

*Ted* `~rovnys-ricfur` shared a [convincing argument](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/pull/1129) for uppercasing Hoon and someone launched [Urbit Classic](http://urbit-classic.org/), running 2016-era Arvo. To be clear, we don't recommend sending them Bitcoin.

Until next time.
