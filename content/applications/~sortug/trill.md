### Your own social feed, forever.

Urbit is a networked personal server. It is the ideal stack to host a microblog service.

For years Urbit users have been busy chatting to each other, coordinating to build the network. But it is time that we lay back a little and just post at our leisure.

Trill is an Urbit native microblog. You can post text or media links into your feed, make threads, and share it with your friends and followers. You can also build a timeline of your favorite Urbit users, and keep lists of users, categorized as you want.

Unlike other microblogs, however, users of Trill truly own their feed. Users host their own content. They can even program it; tinker with the source as much as you want.

There are no ads in Trill, no "trends", no analytics. We don't even know how many people are using Trill. And we don't care. We just want to trill. Please join the party.

### More information
You can install the app by searching for ~dister-dozzod-sortug on your Grid interface, or by running `|install ~dister-dozzod-sortug %trill` in Dojo.

The official group of the app is at ~hoster-dozzod-sortug/trill on the Groups app.
