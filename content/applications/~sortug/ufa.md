### Own your content, share it with your friends

Urbit is your personal server. Why do you want a personal server? Many things. But one of them, part of the initial vision of Urbit's development, was to use to interact programatically with the Web. To interact with Web services, but in your own terms. Using your chosen frontend, blocking all tracking, telemetry, analytics and other malicious code. Urbit as an API aggregator.

The Urbit Feed Aggregator (aka UFA) makes that vision true. Now you will be able to browse the best content on the internet, but really own it, like people used to own books, magazines and newspapers. Control, curate, save and share your the content you like, with complete freedom.

UFA is not just an app, it's a platform to which a myriad apps will be added in the future. As of present (August 2022) UFA includes support for Trill (our sister app, the Urbit native microblog) and Twitter. You can read and keep lists of Twitter content without having to login to Twitter.com, and you can save and share that content inside Urbit, via the Trill or Groups apps.

### More information
You can install the app by searching for ~dister-dozzod-sortug on your Grid interface, or by running `|install ~dister-dozzod-sortug %ufa` in Dojo.

The official group of the app is at ~hoster-dozzod-sortug/ufa on the Groups app.

You can also follow ~sortug on Trill for announcements.

Within 2022 RSS, Instagram and Email support will be added. For the future, the sky is the limit. If you want to help create a new plugin for UFA, please contact us at the official group.
