Memorize passages of text. Every passage is called a “kenning”.

1. Every kenning is assigned a kelvin version based on word count.
1. You may test your knowledge by filling in the blanks.
1. As kelvin decreases, the number of blanks increases.
1. For large passages, split the text into several kens for best results.
