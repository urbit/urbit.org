### A Proof of Attendance Protocol for Urbit

Gora is a proof of presence protocol (POPP) that is
intended to be extensible, flexible and educational
(at least for new hooners).

Gora has two distros in
circulation - these can be found at:
~laddys-dozzod-dalten (Vue.js frontend)

The canonical distro for all Quartus and Dalten Collective apps can always be found at ~dister-dozzod-dalten
