Keep is backup utility for preserving the state of your applications across breaches. Unlike [peat](https://urbit.org/ecosystem/applications/~dister-dozzod-dalten/peat), Keep can backup the state of any arbitrary agent, but does not offer granular control of specific graphs or other targeted contexts.

For support with any of Quartus' applications, please visit the [Quartus public group](https://urbit.org/ecosystem/groups/~mister-hilper-dozzod-dalten/quartus)
