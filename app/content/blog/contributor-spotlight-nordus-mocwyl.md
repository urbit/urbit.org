**\~sarlev:** What drew you into the idea that we needed to throw away and rewrite like the entire network computing stack?  

**\~nordus-mocwyl:** I like this question, but I don't have a great answer for because I didn't conceive of that part of the idea space until after getting into Urbit. So like because I'm a musician, not a computer science like graduate or anything like that, I didn't have any preconceived notions about the technical stack that we use every day. Urbit introduced me to the idea itself, and from there learned much more about the technical underpinnings of computing.

**\~sarlev:** What was it that drew you to Urbit in general, then?
**~nordus-mocwyl:** What drew me to Urbit wa my own personal research for how musicians can just be independent musicians, or at least as as independent as possible. It comes from a perspective of a [~dalten](https://dalten.org) kind of sovereignty thing as i just want musicians to own as much of their career. I was looking into this because when I was in music school the the 'road map' at the time was get a band, play live shows, make a demo, send it to record labels and then hope you make it big. It was the whole world of trying to get radio plays and musicians getting taken advantage of by the record labels. It was a big problem.

And right at the at the tail end of me being in college for music was when um like YouTube was kind of more of a thing.  

Through all this it became clear to me that the internet can make the life of an independent musician actually work. Not just the 1% that can make it big but all the little musicians that people who know them want to see more of them, and more than that they actually want to see them succeed. So you havethis domino effect of YouTube leading into Patreon and to your website to come to your shows. So I was really interested in the question "how does YouTube allow musicians to stay independent?" And then when Patreon came out because I was like, "oh, this is perfect". But that sent me down the rabbit hole looking for more independence. I learned how to make make a website, to make a podcast and get it out there and that's when I got my hands dirty with computer stuff.

I think sometime after I realized how powerful having a website is I started to figure out that even having something like Squarespace was a walled garden and endless sbuscription payments. So when I found Urbit and learned I could actually run my own personal server,  this is this is really the actual ultimate like the musician can do and be everything for themselves. That was a big unlock.

**\~sarlev:** It sounds like musicians are trapped in this cookie cutter, you know, mold... Maybe you could you could even say only shooting stars break the mold... sorry, I'll show myself out for that reference. What parts of Urbit as a system do you feel like have offered you that sovereignty in practice? What do you think, for a musician, or a small creator, can positively impact their life?

**\~nordus-mocwyl:** If there's going to be like a theme to this interview, it's that I'm just going to try to keep it simple wherever I can. What is the bare minimum you need to be able to do on the internet, to operate as a full internet citizen? [I talked about in one of my videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnkxVwm99xQ), and try to really figure out what the networked computing equivalence of a driver's license is. The things without which you just can't operate in the digital world around you. Take serving files for example. If you want to be an internet citizen you need to be able to do this. Expanding out from just files, you need to be able to serve, and have control, over your website—not pay Squarespace or whatever—but then for musicians it is steps beyond that in their distribution, their group and gated access with payment rails. It's really not that much, but is such a nightmare when you wake up to the fact that so much of this is controlled by others, when really it feels like it should be so simple.
   
I just want to make it easy for the long tail of musicians who aren't trying to go triple platinum, but who think to themselves, "I just want to make music and it would be great if I had direct connections with my audience"

**\~sarlev:** You had a unique path into programming, going to music school, but then going and learning hoon and making your own independent software. It sounds like this all came out of a desire to have deep independence; do you feel like that yearing exists for a lot of other musicians and they just maybe don't know it is a thread worth pulling on? Why aren't 40,000 musicians on Urbit that are all making their own website or community groups?

**\~nordus-mocwyl:** Yeah, it's kind of a bummer because Urbit does have a history of attracting a band. Some band showed up from listening to Justin Murphy's podcast, I think. They learned about `~littel-wolfur`'s discord connector and setting up an Oracle cloud free server and he was just setting up as many of those instances as possible for his followers to get on to Tlon's Groups app and then like created the tunnel between that and Discord. They were super stoked about it and I think just the promises didn't really become real for them. 

**\~sarlev:** What else do you want to be able to do with your personal server? You've said, "hey, I want my group, I want to be able to serve a website, serve files, and take payments there." Where do you see it going from there?  

**\~nordus-mocwyl:** It's really it. It's 100% it. It's a very small scope.  

**\~sarlev:** You've mentioned Hawk, and it is those things that you have really picked up and run with. What have you seen that do for you?  

**~nordus-mocwyl:**  I think Hawk does a really good job of being like a gateway drug. It starts by giving you a very functional website builder, but it can definitely do more than that too. As I mentioned, I built the whole guitar course in Hawk but that definitely took a bit of trailblazing. I don't think it would take much, maybe a really well done walkthrough, to make that capability much more accessible. Something where you ramp people up from the bare bones to the much more complex. You could start simple: open up your hawk and write plain text. Then a little markdown. Then your HTML. Then `%sail`. And beyond that could could do components in the namespace and plug those in into your `%sail` and Udon and all this stuff.  

There is so much that Hawk can do so I'm getting a bit carried away, but I think there is a really gentle ramp up that is possibleIt just needs the breadcrumbs to get laid there. Regardless, I think there's just no better tool than Hawk for making a website in my mind. 

TK
Um as but like does have um so right now like I can't you know I couldn't serve my videos directly there. So like I embed from from YouTube and so um with V 64 I should be able to do that. I just don't know what that like what load that's going to have on my server and stuff because it's like you know when people send you links from Google Drive to watch a video like it's pretty miserable.  
**\~sarlev:** Uhhuh.  
**~nordus-mocwyl:** Like YouTube has totally conditioned me to click on something and have it play before I can even hit the pause button.  
   
 

### 00:21:09

   
**~nordus-mocwyl:** like before the pause button loads, which is annoying in itself, but like really impressive.  
**\~sarlev:** Yeah. Well, it's it's interesting though even like you mentioned this piece about the the pause button. Um, and I like you know in terms of my like technical questions that I had to ask is like where in the legacy computing world do you struggle with these like fundamental or systemic issues that are just like wholly not a concern with it? And it like to me this like pause button loading after the video has started loading is just one of these like little examples of like how is it that Google's incentives about what they want you to do like inform the things that work well versus the things that don't work well. Like they don't really want you to pause the video. Like they want you to watch the video.  
**~nordus-mocwyl:** No. Yeah.  
**\~sarlev:** And so like that that just seeps through into this like general like well when they're optimizing their video player to play you know billions of hours of mu movies every day like well well I guess we're going to make the loading much more higher priority than like loading a button to pause it like you know I don't know if you see that in like the rest of your computing experience as well.  
   
 

### 00:22:21

   
**~nordus-mocwyl:** Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. the like so this kind of comes back to like answering the question that you were were going to ask the uh the straight ahead one the um oh like what was the thing that drew you to it to  
**\~sarlev:** H Yeah.  
**~nordus-mocwyl:** like it let you know that we should throw it away we need to throw everything and rewrite the entire like network and computer stack and so like after getting into it um that's when I like I like understood it's like oh When people were excited about desktop computers, they were excited about like not just getting on the internet and consuming everything but like serving the internet like that was that was a part of it was like everyone was able to like add files to it and then like other people could pull from it. And when you realize that it's like uh the the only like the reason that like like when you when you realize why AWS exists um it's like okay like like like having your own server is just like a pain in the ass.  
   
 

### 00:23:40

   
**~nordus-mocwyl:** Like it's such a big headache that like nobody no no sane person is going to do it. Um, and the consequence is is that you like you give away the actually important valuable part of being a part of the internet and you like outsource it and like and you realize how power like you can realize how powerful it is because like like that you did that to like Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Apple like like um like Amazon and so like like giving up the most powerful part of having a computer on the internet ended up being like centralizing all this like all this power and money. Um and so yeah, like rewriting it so that an average person can just have a server so they can do their humble little things like um send like I want to send my baby pictures right to my mom's computer and that's it. like I just want I want my computer to have the baby pictures and then when when her computer is ready, it can download it and put it on her computer or just stream it from my computer.  
   
 

### 00:24:56

   
**~nordus-mocwyl:** Um, whichever thing kind of works. And like that's that's how I want it to operate. Like I I don't want a middleman, anybody like searching the pixels and all this. And it's like not even from a p privacy thing, just like from a sanity like direct connection thing like that. I want to be in a computer world that acts like actual reality, not this like yeah really unfortunate thing that we've like set up in. So yeah, like we gota we have to rewrite it so that we could reclaim that like serving part of our computers.  
**\~sarlev:** Yeah, it's interesting. It's like it it feels like that once you know that this exists, it's almost like, you know, urban as an infohazard that like it starts to propagate back into the rest of your computing experience. Uh, and so like, you know, I'm I'm curious how this experience or realization has changed your relationship with computers, like since you found out about Urban, like you you came as a musician, you're like, I want to be  
   
 

### 00:25:49

   
**~nordus-mocwyl:** Okay. Yeah.  
**\~sarlev:** a bit more independent, and then you kind of like learned all of the technical underpinnings for like why that isn't necessarily the case, but like how has that kind of propagated back into the rest of your computing experience  
**~nordus-mocwyl:** Yeah.  
**\~sarlev:** so far?  
**~nordus-mocwyl:** You know, it's f like I guess I'll have to like go a little bit away from like the whole server part like the just serving files theme that I do want to hit on. Like the biggest thing that like interacting with Urbbit changed my computing is just like um like I just get what the I just get what the zeros and ones are about like um learning hoon and then learning knock just like helped me understand assembly like it helped me understand like what computation is like here's what compute is and that's something I just never understood um and that means like now I understand backend stuff and like knowing that and knowing like like having like a you know dec like you know like even like a passing understanding of knock like gives you the sensation that you could understand you could understand it all the way down and like for the particular part of the spectrum that I inhabit like that's really satisfying.  
   
 

### 00:27:22

   
**~nordus-mocwyl:** there's like there's there's very little in the world that you can actually understand all the way down and then like uh be satisfied with building up from that like kind of those that knowledge. Um, and so yeah, getting the ability to believe that I could understand the computer all the way through like um like that's unbelievable. Like like you think about um learning like HTML and CSS for a web page and then you like now you have to understand the browser. Okay. Well, now you have to understand like applications sitting on top of an Apple computer. now you got to understand the Apple computer and all the uh the the assembly code at the bottom and like the x86 stuff and it's like okay well that's you know it's like see the textbooks from computer science like like graduates it's just like no absolutely not hell no uh but you learn you learn knock and you learn hon gall agents and then hawk it's pretty manageable like I' I've messed around with my hawk all the time. Yeah.  
   
 

### 00:28:32

   
**\~sarlev:** Yeah, that's that's great. Um, so maybe like you know wandering away our way into like a little bit more of this technical stuff like um you know I think you mentioned like you can actually understand from like the assembly level up to like oh this is like my website and this is why it's rendering this way. Um, are there other places sort of in like the legacy computing world where you struggled with like these systemic issues that are wholly not a concern in Urbbit? Is it mostly just this simplicity layer that's that's been beneficial?  
**~nordus-mocwyl:** Yeah. When I when I looked at that, um the thing that came to mind for me was like um in the legacy world like you just don't know like like who am I talking to? Um is like such a like um I don't know. It's like it's like people almost don't even see that as a problem. Um, but like IP addresses tell you literally nothing about who is talking to you because of like how we like ping everything and like IP address does not mean a a computer and that was the idea, right?  
   
 

### 00:29:50

   
**~nordus-mocwyl:** like here's the computer and then like here's kind of my identity in a way, but it it became too much of like a it it became too much of more like a if my identity was my physical address  
**\~sarlev:** Mhm.  
**~nordus-mocwyl:** and it's like okay but I'll move right like or I'll be in like Minnesota at some point. Um, and so it just doesn't work. But like, yeah, if somebody But with Urbbit, like you get to somebody shows up, they get to prove who they are and you get to tell them, "Oh, great. I'm glad you're here. You can have you can see all of this stuff. Uh, like I'm serving these things and you have access to it." Um, or like, "Oh, shoot. Like you're that guy. Well, like forget you. I'm not taking any packages from you." like um and that's a really big deal. Like it's a really big deal and it brings it into like much more of like a reality of stuff. And so that's one of the um that's one of my problems with Hawk right now is that uh I can't I can't do access control and it's like a two-part problem because first I have to have everybody on urban and then I have to have Hawk be able to say only this set of ships can see can get into the guitar course.  
   
 

### 00:31:07

   
**~nordus-mocwyl:** Um, and both of those and like both of those things aren't solved. Uh, yeah.  
**\~sarlev:** what what do you have an opinion on how that solution comes to pass or is it just like look I just need these two things I need people to have they're running orbit ships I don't care if they're self-hosted or TLONH hosted or you know running or you know whatever else like we just need to have people with running ships and then I want like is it ident is it individualbased access controls do you want to  
**~nordus-mocwyl:** Yeah. Comets or moons or  
**\~sarlev:** be able to do you know group based permissions like what's the your eyes lit up with with that  
**~nordus-mocwyl:** Oh man, I know you got me. You got me cuz it's like I think Ton Groups is getting worse as a chat app and the one thing that they re they have that I really want is like really robust group um like group enrolls combining. And so like I just I want access to it. like I I want my hawk to be able to um go and ask groups and be like, "Hey, you have uh the guitar course group, everybody who has the role that they're that they're paid or that they're in the course like um they have access.  
   
 

### 00:32:34

   
**~nordus-mocwyl:** So when somebody shows up to my page, it goes and is like, "Okay, this is who you are. Let me go check the list from groups, which changes all the time. Okay, you're in. Good. Awesome." you know, um it's not here's how you pay, you know, like that's um that's what I want groups to do.  
**\~sarlev:** Yeah.  
**~nordus-mocwyl:** Let me like that's the good part.  
**\~sarlev:** Right. Like give give me give me the groups information about groups like I I want to know about the group give and then propagate that out to the rest of my  
**~nordus-mocwyl:** Yes. Yeah. Yeah. That's what Yeah. That's how I want to control the do the access control. Um, as far as like my opinion of how we should do it, I'm a huge I'm a huge shrubbery guy. Um, I think I think it's a mistake that we're not uh like paying Liam to make the vein for shrubbery. Um, if because it's like the truth is like really a lot of the great stuff in urban is in clay.  
   
 

### 00:33:37

   
**~nordus-mocwyl:** Um, and like Clay Clay does what I want. Uh, Clay serves files, Clay does access control, and Clay does like revision control, which I haven't like talked about, but it's like Hawk doesn't do that. You'll you'll lose your data.  
**\~sarlev:** Yeah.  
**~nordus-mocwyl:** Um, and I think it's a shame Hawk or I'm a shame that Clay has become less of a file system and more of like a hoon builder. Um, but it's like that stuff is just sitting there like it's it could be used that way. Um, and so I I think yeah, like Gaul wasn't the right app model. I think I think so. Yeah, I I my my opinion is that we need to have a namespace file system pretty much identical with clay, but make it make it shrubbery. Um where things can talk to each other and apps and like the state of the apps is just spilled out into the name space and um you work out the way that they coordinate um read and write between each other and u yeah that kind of thing.  
   
 

### 00:34:43

   
**~nordus-mocwyl:** So yeah, yeah.  
**\~sarlev:** And you you've uh been doing this whole uh video series too on like uh debrief or maybe maybe even call postmortem on on call. Uh, you know, it's it's it's fun to talk to people about like their different opinions, let's say, on user space. Like some people are like, "Oh, it's great. We  
**~nordus-mocwyl:** Okay. Yeah.  
**\~sarlev:** just need to, you know, change these few things." Other people are like, "Well, actually, I just want like clay." Like clay is mostly what I want. Um there's there's obviously like the uh shrubbery as meta category for things that are not in current existence but that I want to exist that make composability easy or you know whatever else.  
**~nordus-mocwyl:** Yeah.  
**\~sarlev:** uh like yeah I guess you kind of started to answer it but like what thread do you want to see pulled you know with regard to changes to user space or the the urban application model like what is that uh step forward look look like to  
   
 

### 00:35:58

   
**~nordus-mocwyl:** Heat. Um, yeah, I do I do think it is like just taking shrubbery seriously just like as a u as like a group because like I think hawk hawk is the best example. It's like okay we we fused the browser with a shrubbery and it's like it's just it's a it's a killer app. Like it's a it go it's like gang busters. like it's it's really really good. Um now we just have to like make it more urban like we need to get it closer to the kernel. Um and it's like I know people are working on it and smarter people than I am working on it. Um yeah.  
**\~sarlev:** What is what is Hawk missing currently that it would get from, you know, being close with the colonel running its own vein?  
**~nordus-mocwyl:** Yeah.  
**\~sarlev:** You know, is are the concerns a performance one or or other uh  
**~nordus-mocwyl:** Whoa. I guess I don't know about performance. Um, one of the like kind of silly ones is just revision control.  
   
 

### 00:37:10

   
**~nordus-mocwyl:** Um, Clay already has it. I'm sure Hawk could do it, but like should you rewrite stuff that Clay does into a G app? Probably not. Uh the after revision control is um it's funny because it's like this is 100% the topics that I've been thinking about the past week. Um the other is like being able to share something across the network. So especially like sync something across the network. So Hawk can't do that. It it could um but like Clay has it like um everybody is like getting updates like without any problems all over with all the desks like that they've installed and stuff. And so being able to like Clay syncs across the network just fine. Um I would love for because I would love for my guitar course to be on somebody else's hawk and then when I make a change it just updates. Um and then the last thing is just is access control that like granular access control like uh ship ship based because you can make it public or not but I want it to be like hey I want it to be go to groups and see who's in that list that have that have the role like double check it and then let them in you know that's what I want it to be.  
   
 

### 00:38:36

   
**\~sarlev:** Yeah, neat. Um, so you know, user space will continue to evolve as as people kind of have have different demands on it. Um you you talked a little bit about uh you know a desire for access controls you know obviously there's the sort of file serve and stuff will get better enabled by VE 64 um you know what are you working on currently you you've got this uh guitar course that we've alluded to and I'm sure the audience is on the edge of their chairs being like what there's a musician that became a Hoon developer and is building things. Um, you know, what what do you what is that? What are you working on?  
**~nordus-mocwyl:** Yeah. Yeah. So, it's been it's it's definitely the guitar course. Um it's not in its final form, but it's in like a totally consumable first start. Um and so yeah, it's a it's on Hawk. So, the guitar chorus is completely on hawk. The uh I do because of the limitations that we talked about, I did have to like um it is not like it's not exactly what it needs to be.  
   
 

### 00:40:02

   
**~nordus-mocwyl:** Uh and so I'm working on like making it easier for somebody who's not on her to get on her like just just for the course. like no other they don't even they don't have to hear the word erbit. They're just like I'm like, "Okay, cool. You paid. Here's the URL because I'm hosting everything and everything's already set up and here's your code. Here's here's here you go." Like there's the course. Oh, by the way, there's a there's a whole virtual computer behind it and you can mess around with it if you want. Um, and yeah, getting people on her bit is the big one. And then yeah, like figuring out how to do the access control with Hawk, which is something I Yeah. and payments. Payments is would be a really big one. Um yeah. Yeah. The I not everybody's on crypto, so that's also a problem. So I'll probably always have to do Stripe um for credit cards, at least until like uh the number of people on crypto that would also want a guitar course is like sufficient for sustaining me and my family, you know.  
   
 

### 00:41:14

   
**\~sarlev:** Yep. Yep.  
**~nordus-mocwyl:** Yeah.  
**\~sarlev:** Yeah. The uh the overlapping vin diagram needs to grow just more.  
**~nordus-mocwyl:** Yeah. Yeah. Which is, you know, I think the odds are good. Like like crypto bros and guitar, you people want to be good at guitar. Like people want to be good on guitar is a very big circle.  
**\~sarlev:** Yeah. Yeah.  
**~nordus-mocwyl:** It's a really large circle.  
**\~sarlev:** Yeah.  
**~nordus-mocwyl:** So like like like capturing the nerds and the crypto people and the um smart smart people who decided to make money instead of learn guitar. Um their time to come back. Yeah. Yeah.  
**\~sarlev:** Nice.  
**~nordus-mocwyl:** Actually get good. Um so yeah I want to make the guitar course I just want Yeah. I want it to go more and more fully Yeah. urban. Um, I I was able to hack together an access control with Hawk. So, um, and I I think that and I think that was like kind of magical.  
   
 

### 00:42:15

   
**~nordus-mocwyl:** So, I showed my other guitar students who who were who were urbers and they were like like like I think being able to log in, see your name up on a thing just like feels really good because it's I guess that's I guess I didn't go over that, but it's like the guitar course is I'm it's centralized to me.  
**\~sarlev:** Huh?  
**~nordus-mocwyl:** like I'm serving the guitar course and I'm giving people access to it. Um, it could be distributed where I send it out, but like I said with the I can't really sync it. Um, and yeah, if it was a G app, I could I could.  
**\~sarlev:** Uh um so Okay.  
**~nordus-mocwyl:** Um, but that's more work than I'd want it to be. Yeah. Yeah. I think I want to raise Oh, like if there's anything more that I want to do, I'd like to make the the growing of the guitar course to also be like a charity fundraiser um for like my I like I just love give directly. And so I'm thinking every time I make like an improvement, I can I can raise the price and then that difference goes to goes to charity.  
   
 

### 00:43:31

   
**\~sarlev:** Yeah.  
**~nordus-mocwyl:** I think I I I think that's the route I want to go.  
**\~sarlev:** Well, I mean you like I'm I'm kind of curious to hear a little bit more about because you you've done fund and like it's always been a big part of like your different work uh let's call it around  
**~nordus-mocwyl:** So  
**\~sarlev:** Urbbit or tangential to Urbbit to to work with give directly um like how did you get into that? What what kind of drives you to to do that? I'm curious.  
**~nordus-mocwyl:** that was good. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Because it's kind of out of nowhere. Um, where does this start I guess like I that's such a that's such a good question. You know what it is? Okay, so when Patreon came onto the scene um I was like okay cool. Like this is it. Uh, and I I kind of when I was trying to think through what what musicians need, I I kind of ended up like it was kind of also around the world of uh of of UBI, universal basic income.  
   
 

### 00:44:44

   
**~nordus-mocwyl:** And so like that kind of was like I was kind of in the mind space. And I was I kind of I just realized that um in economic terms, you just you can't pay a musician to go do what they're going to want to go do. Um, like I think I think the world wants the world wants or should want musicians to just like go and make music.  
**\~sarlev:** Mhm.  
**~nordus-mocwyl:** Like, hey, you have a thing that you are absolutely compelled to do. It is like um you don't really have a choice. You're going to go do it. uh if people would just recognize that that's what somebody's going to do like then like a UBI would just be amazing for that where it's like hey you're um you don't have to worry about food or shelter like here like go go do what's what you're compelled to do and so like I always thought of musicians as kind of the counterargument for people thinking uh a UBI means that everybody would just like be on the dole and literally sit around and do nothing because it's like musicians it's like making music is like compulsory like there's no you don't have a choice in the matter really.  
   
 

### 00:46:03

   
**~nordus-mocwyl:** Um, and I always thought like musicians were a really interesting kind of canary in the coal mine.  
**\~sarlev:** Mhm.  
**~nordus-mocwyl:** like I think they're the group that would need the UBI first and um at the same time like you see what machines and then computers and then now AI makes it like it makes it harder and harder to pay somebody to do the work that like you're econom like like you have to like fake economically to pay them like like what they can give into the economic IC world and into the market is not equal to what they need to live and survive. And so you have to decouple that at some point. And musicians are already there. Like there was this weird time period where they could like press sound into vinyl and then like have it be a physical thing and ship it to people. And then like the whole industry exploded and like you could actually do something with that. Um, but like then it went digital and like well now now music is this ephemeral thing again that you can't like package and sell.  
   
 

### 00:47:13

   
**~nordus-mocwyl:** Um, but people want like like we want the musicians to be making the music and so I saw Patreon at the time, this is such a long explanation. I saw Patreon at the time as like the uh democratized UBI. It's like let's just do it ourselves. Like um I have things that I want to see in the world. it it catches me and then I'm like, "Okay, you do you do your thing and I'll I'll give you $9 a month. I'll like, you know, I'll have I'll have my budget for music and in art and what I want to see and I'll I'll divvy it up among the people that I want and then you get um this is also like the gosh, my you stepped in a uh this this also is like my um thousand true fans. So $9 a month thousand people that's a you know six figure salary and it's like it to like super doable numbers uh really doable numbers and like I saw that and I had that vision for all my musician  
   
 

### 00:47:56

   
**\~sarlev:** Mhm. Yep.  
**~nordus-mocwyl:** friends. So I was like okay like let's get you a thousand people giving you $9 a month. Um, and when I thought about it, eventually I I came to the idea of like, well, I think you should also be doing good, right? Like you shouldn't you shouldn't the end result is not just like a musician that like never has to think about m money again. Um, I think people are going to feel better about um giving money freely to musicians to just kind of like do what they're doing if at the same time you're also um taking the same concept of UBI and then like uplifting the poorest in the world. And so yeah, I like had an inkling that like there should be a coupling with charity. um that charity kind of like charity could really use a um kind of market force person to like do some advertising and kind of champion them and like do the overhead that they're not allowed to pay for for marketing and stuff.  
   
 

### 00:49:17

   
**~nordus-mocwyl:** And so I I thought like there's an amazing pairing of like hey I'm asking you for money for me and for this thing and the uh the thing that rhymes with it the most is like the give directly as well as like I just morally believe that like the the highest level of dignity and charity is like the you just give money to to people like you figure it out. And it's like I kind of feel like that was true in my life, but it's like my parents just basically like here's you got to go figure it out. But it's like okay well I think like I I would like to see that more for other people so they can do more interesting things in the world. And um so yeah give directly is like because yeah looking into charities it's like it's such a I don't know it's like sad or abysmal. It's I don't know it feels weird like what you could give to and so like give directly was like a was a work for me for a while like just like years of like okay what charity is like  
   
 

### 00:50:06

   
**\~sarlev:** Uhhuh.  
**~nordus-mocwyl:** what do I actually believe in and like give directly was the end result and has come back over and over. So yeah, 20 minute answer.  
**\~sarlev:** That's That's cool. No, like I've I've always I've always been curious like what, you know, why why give directly? like what where where did that come from? Like that that whole thread because it has been this this throughine in what you're doing and I think it's just like fascinating. I I like the way you describe it. You're like, "Give me somebody like look, we're I'll help you give just give me make sure that it goes in the same place, too."  
**~nordus-mocwyl:** Yeah.  
**\~sarlev:** Like Yeah.  
**~nordus-mocwyl:** Yeah. Yeah. You you want to give to charity, but you don't want to like spend the time to figure out if it's worthwhile or not. But you see somebody stoked about it and you're like it's like like I know this thing, you know, and like here have a thing and I'll give to charity like  
   
 

### 00:50:55

   
**\~sarlev:** Yeah. Yeah. That's good. Um I think like you know just on the the last question if you weren't working on it you know what would you be doing instead like you know obviously you're also you're also doing a lot of stuff I I I think unlike you know some of the call them like you know runtime devs or whatever who are like I'm writing CC code here and if I wasn't writing CC code here I'd probably write CC code somewhere else also but I'm glad that I'm doing it on Uh, you know, you're also a musician and you're like doing cool stuff that isn't computer science, you know, deep computer science research.  
**~nordus-mocwyl:** Yeah.  
**\~sarlev:** Like what what would you be doing instead if you weren't doing urban things?  
**~nordus-mocwyl:** Oh man, I I struggled with this one when I was thinking about it. I was like the first thing that popped to my mind is like oh gosh if I hadn't heard the word urbbit would I like maybe I would be doing construction like I was almost going in that direction for a while.  
   
 

### 00:52:03

   
**~nordus-mocwyl:** Um I think probably a realistic answer is uh this is a guitar course that I've wanted to make for a long time. Um, and so I probably would have built it and put it on Skillshare and then just kind of done maybe I would have like made a Patreon and like Skillshare or something like that. Like I would maybe figured out Yeah. the same kind of thing. Um, but I feel like yeah, less about me, I guess. like my I think if I didn't find it, my general outlook of computing and like computers and the internet would just be like totally blackfilled. Like I would just be I would just be bummed out about the direction of technology. Um like I probably still would have been excited about like DeFi, but like now I'm kind of bummed out about it. I probably would have gotten gotten excited about AI, but now I'm just kind of bummed out about that now. Uh, and like urban is the thing that like I got excited about and it's still like bright and it's still like yes and we need that and I'm not bummed out about it.  
   
 

### 00:53:11

   
**~nordus-mocwyl:** Um, and so yeah, I think yeah, I'd probably just like less and less internet for me uh if there was no urban. Yeah.
